Recently, multi-task\nnetworks have shown to both offer additional estimation capabilities, and, perhaps more\nimportantly, increased performance over single-task networks on a \u201cmain/primary\u201d task. However,\nbalancing the optimization criteria of multi-task networks across different tasks is an area of active\nexploration. Here, we extend a previously proposed 3D attention-based network with four\nadditional multi-task subnetworks for the detection of lung cancer and four auxiliary tasks\n(diagnosis of asthma, chronic bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and emphysema).\nAuthor Manuscript\nWe introduce and evaluate a learning policy, Periodic Focusing Learning Policy (PFLP), that\nalternates the dominance of tasks throughout the training. To improve performance on the primary\ntask, we propose an Internal-Transfer Weighting (ITW) strategy to suppress the loss functions on\nauxiliary tasks for the final stages of training. To evaluate this approach, we examined 3386\npatients (single scan per patient) from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) and de-identified\ndata from the Vanderbilt Lung Screening Program, with a 2517/277/592 (scans) split for training,\nvalidation, and testing. Baseline networks include a single-task strategy and a multi-task strategy\nwithout adaptive weights (PFLP/ITW), while primary experiments are multi-task trials with either\nPFLP or ITW or both. On the test set for lung cancer prediction, the baseline single-task network\nachieved prediction AUC of 0.8080 and multi-task baseline failed to converge (AUC 0.6720).\nHowever, applying PFLP helped multi-task network clarify and achieved test set lung cancer\nprediction AUC of 0.8402. Furthermore, our ITW technique boosted the PFLP enabled multi-task\nAuthor Manuscript\nnetwork and achieved an AUC of 0.8462 (McNemar test, p < 0.01). In conclusion, adaptive\nconsideration of multi-task learning weights is important, and PFLP and ITW are promising\nstrategies.\nKeywords\nComputed Tomography; Lung Cancer; Deep Learning; Multi-Task\n*\nCorresponding Author: riqiang.gao@vanderbilt.edu.\nYang et \n\n---\n\n[Mary Kay Washington 2022, PMID:35326553]\nTitle: Unfolded Protein Response Is Activated by Aurora Kinase A in Esophageal Adenocarcinoma.\nAbstract: Unfolded protein response (UPR) protects malignant cells from endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis. We report that Aurora kinase A (AURKA) promotes cancer cell survival by activating UPR in esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). A strong positive correlation between AURKA and binding immunoglobulin protein (BIP) mRNA expression levels was found in EACs. The in vitro assays indicated that AURKA promoted IRE1\u03b1 protein phosphorylation, activating prosurvival UPR in FLO-1 and OE33 cells. The use of acidic bile salts to mimic reflux conditions in patients induced high AURKA and IRE1\u03b1 levels. This induction was abrogated by AURKA knockdown in EAC cells. AURKA and p-IRE1\u03b1 protein colocalization was observed in neoplastic gastroesophageal lesions of the L2-IL1b mouse model of Barrett's esophageal neoplasia. The combined treatment using AURKA inhibitor and tunicamycin synergistically induced cancer cell death. The use of alisertib for AURKA inhibition in the EAC xenograft model led to a decrease in IRE1\u03b1 phosphorylation with a significant reduction in tumor growth. These results indicate that AURKA activates UPR, promoting cancer cell survival during ER stress in EAC. Targeting AURKA can significantly reverse prosurvival UPR signaling mechanisms and decrease cancer cell survival, providing a promising approach for the treatment of EAC patients.\n\n---\n\n[Tae Hyun Hwang 2025, PMID:40245574]\nTitle: Pictorial essay on selected new, emerging, and reclassified entities in the 2020 WHO classification of soft tissue tumors.\nAbstract: The 2020 WHO classification of soft tissue tumors includes major updates, incorporating new and emerging tumor entities, along with reclassified tumor types, supported by advances in immunohistochemistry and genetic data.

Although it has potential uses in nutraceutical research, it has developed into a formidable tool for drug development. Bioactive substances called nutraceuticals are present in food sources and can be used in the management of diseases. Finding their molecular targets can help in the creation of disease-specific new therapies. The purpose of this review was to explore molecular docking's application to the study of dietary supplements and disease management. First, an overview of the fundamentals of molecular docking and the various software tools available for docking was presented. The limitations and difficulties of using molecular docking in nutraceutical research are also covered, including the reliability of scoring functions and the requirement for experimental validation. Additionally, there was a focus on the identification of molecular targets for nutraceuticals in numerous disease models, including those for sickle cell disease, cancer, cardiovascular, gut, reproductive, and neurodegenerative disorders. We further highlighted biochemistry pathways and models from recent studies that have revealed molecular mechanisms to pinpoint new nutraceuticals' effects on disease pathogenesis. It is convincingly true that molecular docking is a useful tool for identifying the molecular targets of nutraceuticals in the management of diseases. It may offer information about how nutraceuticals work and support the creation of new therapeutics. Therefore, molecular docking has a bright future in nutraceutical research and has a lot of potentials to lead to the creation of brand-new medicines for the treatment of disease.\n\n---\n\n[Yuankai Huo 2025, PMID:41322092]\nTitle: Polyhedra Encoding Transformers: Enhancing Diffusion MRI Analysis Beyond Voxel and Volumetric Embedding.\nAbstract: 1.

Recent \nyears have seen the emergence of machine learning and data-driven approaches \nthat enhance the speed, accuracy, and consistency of dMRI data analysis. \nHowever, traditional deep learning models often fell short, as they typically \nutilize pixel-level or volumetric patch-level embeddings similar to those used \nin structural MRI, and do not account for the unique distribution of various \ngradient encodings. In this paper, we propose a novel method called Polyhedra \nEncoding Transformer (PE-Transformer) for dMRI, designed specifically to handle \nspherical signals. Our approach involves projecting an icosahedral polygon onto \na unit sphere to resample signals from predetermined directions. These resampled \nsignals are then transformed into embeddings, which are processed by a \ntransformer encoder that incorporates orientational information reflective of \nthe icosahedral structure. Through experimental validation with various gradient \nencoding protocols, our method demonstrates superior accuracy in estimating \nmulti-compartment models and Fiber Orientation Distributions (FOD), \noutperforming both conventional CNN architectures and standard transformers.\n\nDOI: 10.1117/12.3047244\nPMCID: PMC12662718\nPMID: 41322092\n\n---\n\n[Hirak Sarkar 2021, PMID:33640958]\nTitle: In silico identification of key regulators instigating the pre-meiotic phase during respiration in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.\nAbstract: Like higher eukaryotes, diploid MATa/MAT\u03b1 budding yeasts can undergo both mitosis and meiosis. Although the potential reason for their phase switching is elucidated by two consecutive processes, i.e. transition from fermentation (mitotic growth) to respiration in glucose-deficient media and then complete shift to meiotic phase in combined nitrogen- and glucose-starved media, the genomic interactions and regulatory cascade operating this drive remain elusive. Here, we aim to explore the regulatory cross-talk that mediates the phase transition. We have hypothesized that pre-growth in glucose-starved condition (yeast extract-peptone-acetate media) not only causes switch from fermentation to respiration but also prepares them for meiosis via a myriad of signaling events regulated by transcription factors (TFs). We have identified 23 putative TFs from integrated protein-protein interaction and gene regulatory network that were reconstructed from predicted and experimentally validated data. A total of six TFs (Xbp1p, Abf1p, Cbf1p, Ste12p, Reb1p and Gcn4p) are found to be highly connected in the network and involved in the cross-talk between respiration and cellular preparation for meiosis.

Mice were housed with sex-matched littermates and given ad libitum access to standard chow and water, except for a subset of mice that were housed singly to monitor food intake as specified. Animals were allocated by genotype. For all experiments, equal numbers of male and female mice were used and potential sex effects explored in statistical analyses.\n\nG12D mice (Scgb1a1-CreER-KrasLSL-G12D/+) were generated by crossing Scgb1a1-CreER mice with KrasLSL-G12D/+ mice and were maintained on a mixed background. At 4\u20135 months of age, G12D or wild-type Scgb1a1-CreER (WT) littermates were administered five consecutive daily intraperitoneal (IP) injections of 20 mg/mL tamoxifen (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) dissolved in corn oil at a dose of 1 mg tamoxifen/10 g body weight. Body weight was monitored 2\u20133 times weekly and food intake was measured in a subgroup of individually housed mice for 6 weeks. At 6- or 12-week post-tamoxifen injections, mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation under pentobarbital anesthesia. Blood was collected by cardiac puncture in serum separator tubes and centrifuged to isolate serum, aliquoted, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Skeletal muscles, adipose tissues, heart, liver, and spleen were weighed, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Lungs were collected for histology or organoid development. One gastrocnemius, soleus and tibialis anterior muscle were mounted in 7% gum tragacanth, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen-cooled isopentane, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. One inguinal (iWAT) and one perigonadal (gWAT) fat pad were fixed in 10% formalin and paraffin-embedded.\n\nG12D mice were crossed with Lkb1fl/fl (Stk11fl/fl)81 and Ai14 (Rosa26-tdTomato; TD) reporter mice82 to generate KrasG12D/+-TD (G12D), KrasG12D/+-Stk11\u2212/\u2212-TD (KS) and wild-type Scgb1a1-CreER-TD (WT; Kras+/+) littermate control mice. At 8\u201310 weeks of age, G12D, KS, and WT mice were injected (IP) for five consecutive days with tamoxifen (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) dissolved in corn oil as detailed for G12D mice. Body weight and food intake were monitored thrice weekly for 3.5 weeks, after which mice were euthanized, and blood and tissues were collected similar to G12D mice.\n\nMice harboring KrasLSL-G12D (JAX 008179) and Rosa26LSL-tdTomato (Ai14, JAX 007914) alleles were used. Cre recombinase was introduced via oropharyngeal administration of 5 x 107 pfu/mouse of adenoviral Cre (Ad5-CMV-Cre or Ad5mSPC-Cre; University of Iowa Viral Vector Core) diluted in 1X PBS to activate recombination in lung epithelial cells. Initially, mice were monitored once a week and weighed once every other week.

In both cases, anatomical accuracy of tractography is critical for sound scientific conclusions. Here we assess and validate the algorithms and tractography implementations that have been most widely used - often because of ease of use, algorithm simplicity, or availability offered in open source software. Comparing forty tractography results to a ground truth defined by histological tracers in the primary motor cortex on the same squirrel monkey brains, we assess tract fidelity on the scale of voxels as well as over larger spatial domains or regional connectivity. No algorithms are successful in all metrics, and, in fact, some implementations fail to reconstruct large portions of pathways or identify major points of connectivity. The accuracy is most dependent on reconstruction method and tracking algorithm, as well as the seed region and how this region is utilized. We also note a tremendous variability in the results, even though the same MR images act as inputs to all algorithms. In addition, anatomical accuracy is significantly decreased at increased distances from the seed. An analysis of the spatial errors in tractography reveals that many techniques have trouble properly leaving the gray matter, and many only reveal connectivity to adjacent regions of interest. These results show that the most commonly implemented algorithms have several shortcomings and limitations, and choices in implementations lead to very different results. This study should provide guidance for algorithm choices based on study requirements for sensitivity, specificity, or the need to identify particular connections, and should serve as a heuristic for future developments in tractography.\n\n---\n\n[Bennett Landman 2019, PMID:30277272]\nTitle: Functional tractography of white matter by high angular resolution functional-correlation imaging (H\nAbstract: PURPOSE: Functional magnetic resonance imaging with BOLD contrast is widely used for detecting brain activity in the cortex. Recently, several studies have described anisotropic correlations of resting-state BOLD signals between voxels in white matter (WM). These local WM correlations have been modeled as functional-correlation tensors, are largely consistent with underlying WM fiber orientations derived from diffusion MRI, and appear to change during functional activity. However, functional-correlation tensors have several limitations. The use of only nearest-neighbor voxels makes functional-correlation tensors sensitive to noise. Furthermore, adjacent voxels tend to have higher correlations than diagonal voxels, resulting in orientation-related biases. Finally, the tensor model restricts functional correlations to an ellipsoidal bipolar-symmetric shape, and precludes the ability to detect complex functional orientation distributions (FODs). METHODS: We introduce high-angular-resolution functional-correlation imaging (HARFI) to address these limitations. In the same way that high-angular-resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) techniques provide more information than diffusion tensors, we show that the HARFI model is capable of characterizing complex FODs expected to be present in WM. RESULTS: We demonstrate that the unique radial and angular sampling strategy eliminates orientation biases present in tensor models. We further show that HARFI FODs are able to reconstruct known WM pathways. Finally, we show that HARFI allows asymmetric \"bending\" and \"fanning\" distributions, and propose asymmetric and functional indices which may increase fiber tracking specificity, or highlight boundaries between functional regions. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest the HARFI model could be a robust, new way to evaluate anisotropic BOLD signal changes in WM.\n\nGenerate a hypothesis that addresses what is NOT covered by any paper but could be addressed by combining their approaches.\n\nFormat your response as:\n<think>\n[Step-by-step reasoning about the gap]\n</think>\n\nHYPOTHESIS: [One sentence]\nRATIONALE: [Why novel and feasible]\nMETHODS: [Specific approach with datasets]\nEXPECTED OUTCOME: [Testable prediction with metrics]\n\nIMPORTANT: Cite papers as [Author Year, PMID:XXXXX].

Whole brain segmentation is a key neuroimaging technique that allows for region-by-region analysis of the brain. Segmentation is also an important preliminary step that provides spatial and volumetric information for running other neuroimaging pipelines. Spatially localized atlas network tiles (SLANT) is a popular 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) tool that breaks the whole brain segmentation task into localized sub-tasks. Each sub-task involves a specific spatial location handled by an independent 3D convolutional network to provide high resolution whole brain segmentation results. SLANT has been widely used to generate whole brain segmentations from structural scans acquired on 3T MRI. However, the use of SLANT for whole brain segmentation from structural 7T MRI scans has not been successful due to the inhomogeneous image contrast usually seen across the brain in 7T MRI. For instance, we demonstrate the mean percent difference of SLANT label volumes between a 3T scan-rescan is approximately 1.73%, whereas its 3T-7T scan-rescan counterpart has higher differences around 15.13%. Our approach to address this problem is to register the whole brain segmentation performed on 3T MRI to 7T MRI and use this information to finetune SLANT for structural 7T MRI. With the finetuned SLANT pipeline, we observe a lower mean relative difference in the label volumes of ~8.43% acquired from structural 7T MRI data. Dice similarity coefficient between SLANT segmentation on the 3T MRI scan and the after finetuning SLANT segmentation on the 7T MRI increased from 0.79 to 0.83 with p<0.01. These results suggest finetuning of SLANT is a viable solution for improving whole brain segmentation on high resolution 7T structural imaging.\n\n---\n\n[Bennett Landman 2020, PMID:32735601]\nTitle: Distortion correction of diffusion weighted MRI\u00a0without reverse phase-encoding scans or field-maps.\nAbstract: Diffusion magnetic resonance images may suffer from geometric distortions due to susceptibility induced off resonance fields, which cause geometric mismatch with anatomical images and ultimately affect subsequent quantification of microstructural or connectivity indices. State-of-the art diffusion distortion correction methods typically require data acquired with reverse phase encoding directions, resulting in varying magnitudes and orientations of distortion, which allow estimation of an undistorted volume. Alternatively, additional field maps acquisitions can be used along with sequence information to determine warping fields. However, not all imaging protocols include these additional scans and cannot take advantage of state-of-the art distortion correction. To avoid additional acquisitions, structural MRI (undistorted scans) can be used as registration targets for intensity driven correction. In this study, we aim to (1) enable susceptibility distortion correction with historical and/or limited diffusion datasets that do not include specific sequences for distortion correction and (2) avoid the computationally intensive registration procedure typically required for distortion correction using structural scans. To achieve these aims, we use deep learning (3D U-nets) to synthesize an undistorted b0 image that matches geometry of structural T1w images and intensity contrasts from diffusion images. Importantly, the training dataset is heterogenous, consisting of varying acquisitions of both structural and diffusion. We apply our approach to a withheld test set and show that distortions are successfully corrected after processing. We quantitatively evaluate the proposed distortion correction and intensity-based registration against state-of-the-art distortion correction (FSL topup). The results illustrate that the proposed pipeline results in b0 images that are geometrically similar to non-distorted structural images, and more closely match state-of-the-art correction with additional acquisitions. In addition, we show generalizability of the proposed approach to datasets that were not in the original training / validation / testing datasets. These datasets included varying populations, contrasts, resolutions, and magnitudes and orientations of distortion and show efficacious distortion correction. The method is available as a Singularity container, source code, and an executable trained model to facilitate evaluation.\n\n---\n\n[Bennett Landman 2017, PMID:28932410]\nTitle: Quantitative characterization of optic nerve atrophy in patients with multiple sclerosis.\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Optic neuritis (ON) is one of the most common presentations of multiple sclerosis (MS). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the optic nerves is challenging because of retrobulbar motion, orbital fat and susceptibility artifacts from maxillary sinuses; therefore, axonal loss is investigated with the surrogate measure of a single heuristically defined point along the nerve as opposed to volumetric investigation. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is to derive optic nerve volumetrics along the entire nerve length in patients with MS and healthy controls in\u00a0vivo using high-resolution, clinically viable MRI. METHODS: An advanced, isotropic T2-weighted turbo spin echo MRI was applied to 29 MS patients with (14 patients ON+) or without (15 patients ON-) history of ON and 42 healthy volunteers. An automated tool was used to estimate and compare whole optic nerve and surrounding cerebrospinal fluid radii along the length of the nerve. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Only ON+ MS patients had a significantly reduced optic nerve radius compared to healthy controls in the central segment of the optic nerve. Using clinically available MRI methods, we show and quantify ON volume loss for the first time in MS patients.\n\nPropose a novel method combining techniques from at least 2 papers.\n\nFormat your response as:\n<think>\n[Step-by-step reasoning about how methods complement each other]\n</think>\n\nHYPOTHESIS: [Novel combined approach]\nRATIONALE: [Why combining is beneficial]\nMETHODS: [Technical details of integration]\nEXPECTED OUTCOME: [Performance improvements expected]\n\nIMPORTANT: Cite papers as [Author Year, PMID:XXXXX].

Written informed consent was obtained from non-IBD control and CD subjects to obtain serum samples, as well as, terminal ileum (TI) and ascending colon (AC) tissues at the time of scheduled endoscopic procedures. TI and AC tissues from non-IBD control and CD subjects undergoing surgical resection were also obtained from under a separate IRB protocol in coordination with the Comparative Human Tissue Network (CHTN). All samples were obtained as a part of the clinical trial \u201cCombinatorial Single Cell Strategies for a Crohn\u2019s Disease Gut Cell Atlas\u201d, identifier NCT04113733 (clinicaltrials.gov).\n\nBetween December 2019 and January 2022, endoscopy subjects were prospectively recruited in the IBD clinic or GI endoscopy unit at Vanderbilt University Medical Center prior to colonoscopy for CD disease activity assessment or non-IBD indications including colorectal cancer screening or polyp surveillance. Surgical resection subjects were those undergoing resection for CD-related complications or other non-inflammatory indications, including endoscopically unresectable polyps. Patient participation in the current study ended after serum and/or tissue samples were obtained. Exclusion criteria for the study were: pregnancy, known coagulopathy or bleeding disorders, known renal or hepatic impairment, history of organ transplantation, or inability to give informed consent. After appropriate exclusions, there were 65 CD subjects with varying disease activity and 18 non-IBD controls.\n\nFor all participants, demographics including age, gender, medical history, and medication use were determined from participant reporting and review of the electronic medical record. Serum samples were obtained at the time of colonoscopy and were snap frozen with dry ice and then stored at \u221280\u2009\u00b0C39,67. Tissue biopsies for research purposes in the TI and AC were obtained as follows: fresh tissue biopsies were placed in chelation buffer (4\u2009mM EDTA, 0.5\u2009mM DTT in DPBS) for further processing and scRNAseq analysis, and an adjacent set of tissue biopsies were formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) for research blocks. 5\u2009\u00b5m sections were used from each FFPE block and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and examined in a blinded manner by a gastrointestinal pathologist (MKW) and graded accordingly as: inactive (normal_CD, quiescent) or active (mild, moderate, or severe activity).

Our proposed framework can be divided into three sections: (1)\u00a0super-resolution preprocessing, (2)\u00a0coarse unbiased template generation, and (3)\u00a0hierarchical deep probabilistic registration refinement.\n\nComplete pipeline for unbiased eye atlas generation consists of two stages: (1)\u00a0performing a deep learning super-resolution algorithm to enhance image quality and distinguish organ appearances and (2)\u00a0combining metric-based and deep learning-based registration through a hierarchical registration framework for refined anatomical transfer.\n\nWe applied the synthetic multi-orientation resolution enhancement (SMORE) algorithm to generate super-resolution images.9,35 We select SMORE as the super-resolution algorithm because it is self-supervised and does not require external training data. Other self-supervised super-resolution algorithms require orthogonal views of the same image across multiple contrasts36 or train on a batch of images instead of each image independently.37\n\nThe input image for SMORE is an anisotropic volume, modeled with a spatial resolution of l\u00d7l\u00d7h, where l and h have units of mm and h>l. Here, the images have a high ratio between the in-plane resolution and through-plane resolution (h/l>6). SMORE learns a correspondence between low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR) image patches using only the in-plane slices as training data. The output of SMORE is an isotropic HR image with resolution l\u00d7l\u00d7l.\n\nGiven the enriched context from the super-resolution algorithm in the prior step, we can now use the super-resolution images to create a generalized eye organ representation as a population-wise atlas template. Typically, we perform image registration to align and match the eye anatomy with imaging tools, e.g., ANTs and NiftyReg.38,39 However, registration to a single target image with these tools is biased to a single-fixed reference template.\n\nTo tackle this bias, we apply an unbiased template generation method that results in a coarse, generalized template despite the significant variance in eye morphology. Specifically, for each tissue contrast, we randomly sampled a small set of 25 subjects and generated an average mapping to coarsely align the skull region. The initial template is an average mapping of the 25 subjects, meaning it is unbiased to any of the subjects.13,40 We performed hierarchical metric-based registration (consisting of rigid, affine, and then deformable registration) with ANTs to iteratively compute an average mapping in a separate spatial alignment for each tissue contrast. The computed average template in each epoch was the fixed template for the next epoch. We performed the same hierarchical procedure iteratively until the registration loss converged. We leveraged a small popul\n\n---\n\n[Yuankai Huo 2023, PMID:36691973]\nTitle: Prenatal depressive symptoms and childhood development of brain limbic and default mode network structure.\nFull Text (excerpt): # Paper 36691973\n\n**Professor:** Huo\n**PMID:** 36691973\n\n## Full Text\n\nReceived: 18 July 2022       Revised: 20 December 2022       Accepted: 4 January 2023\nDOI: 10.1002/hbm.26216\nRESEARCH ARTICLE\nPrenatal depressive symptoms and childhood development of\nbrain limbic and default mode network structure\nClaire Donnici 1                   | Xiangyu Long 2,3                    | Jess Reynolds 4                     |\n1,2,5,6                                       1,2,5,6,7\nGerald F.

The VALiDATe29 atlas is based on multiple types of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast acquired on 29 squirrel monkeys, and is created using unbiased, nonlinear registration techniques, resulting in a population-averaged stereotaxic coordinate system. The atlas consists of multiple anatomical templates (proton density, T1, and T2* weighted), diffusion MRI templates (fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity), and ex vivo templates (fractional anisotropy and a structural MRI). In addition, the templates are combined with histologically defined cortical labels, and diffusion tractography defined white matter labels. The combination of intensity templates and image segmentations make this atlas suitable for the fundamental atlas applications of spatial normalization and label propagation. Together, this atlas facilitates 3D anatomical localization and region of interest delineation, and enables comparisons of experimental data across different subjects or across different experimental conditions. This article describes the atlas creation and its contents, and demonstrates the use of the VALiDATe29 atlas in typical applications. The atlas is freely available to the scientific community.\n\n---\n\n[Bennett Landman 2025, PMID:40286936]\nTitle: White matter hyperintensities and relapse risk in late-life depression.\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are associated with late-life depression (LLD) and are considered a hallmark of MRI-defined vascular depression. However, their impact on depression recurrence in LLD is less well known. METHODS: We investigated this relationship using data from a 2-year multi-site, longitudinal study, where baseline WMH volumes were obtained using 3\u00a0T FLAIR magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) from 145 participants, of which 102 had remitted LLD and 43 were control participants. We analyzed the effect of baseline WMH volume on LLD relapse over 2\u00a0years using regression and adjusting for total intracranial volume, age, sex, race, education, and study site. We performed survival analyses using a Cox proportional hazard model to determine whether baseline WMH volume was associated with time to relapse in LLD. RESULTS: We found that participants with LLD had greater WMH volume at baseline than control participants, but not if accounting for peripheral cardiovascular disease. Participants with LLD who relapsed within 8\u00a0months of baseline had larger WMH volume than control participants but did not statistically differ from those that remained remitted; this effect was lost when expanding to participants that relapsed at any point in the 2-year study. WMH burden was not associated with time to relapse, suggesting greater WMH volumes are not indicative of faster relapse rates in LLD. CONCLUSION: Our results show that WMH burden may play a role in the early - but not the delayed - relapse of LLD, and they underscore the intricate dynamic of the biological markers underlying LLD treatment response and relapse.\n\n---\n\n[Bennett Landman 2017, PMID:28781412]\nTitle: Multi-Modal and Targeted Imaging Improves Automated Mid-Brain Segmentation.\nAbstract: The basal ganglia and limbic system, particularly the thalamus, putamen, internal and external globus pallidus, substantia nigra, and sub-thalamic nucleus, comprise a clinically relevant signal network for Parkinson's disease. In order to manually trace these structures, a combination of high-resolution and specialized sequences at 7T are used, but it is not feasible to scan clinical patients in those scanners. Targeted imaging sequences at 3T such as F-GATIR, and other optimized inversion recovery sequences, have been presented which enhance contrast in a select group of these structures. In this work, we show that a series of atlases generated at 7T can be used to accurately segment these structures at 3T using a combination of standard and optimized imaging sequences, though no one approach provided the best result across all structures. In the thalamus and putamen, a median Dice coefficient over 0.88 and a mean surface distance less than 1.0mm was achieved using a combination of T1 and an optimized inversion recovery imaging sequences. In the internal and external globus pallidus a Dice over 0.75 and a mean surface distance less than 1.2mm was achieved using a combination of T1 and F-GATIR imaging sequences. In the substantia nigra and sub-thalamic nucleus a Dice coefficient of over 0.6 and a mean surface distance of less than 1.0mm was achieved using the optimized inversion recovery imaging sequence. On average, using T1 and optimized inversion recovery together produced significantly improved segmentation results than any individual modality (p<0.05 wilcox sign-rank test).\n\nGenerate a hypothesis that addresses what is NOT covered by any paper but could be addressed by combining their approaches.\n\nFormat your response as:\n<think>\n[Step-by-step reasoning about the gap]\n</think>\n\nHYPOTHESIS: [One sentence]\nRATIONALE: [Why novel and feasible]\nMETHODS: [Specific approach with datasets]\nEXPECTED OUTCOME: [Testable prediction with metrics]\n\nIMPORTANT: Cite papers as [Author Year, PMID:XXXXX].

Conventional spot-by-spot sequential regression frameworks \nbecome inefficient and unstable at this scale, whereas the inherent extreme \nsparsity and low expression levels of high-resolution ST further complicate both \nprediction and evaluation.\nAPPROACH: To address these limitations, we propose Img2ST-Net, a high-definition \n(HD) histology-to-ST generation framework for efficient and parallel \nhigh-resolution ST prediction. Unlike conventional spot-by-spot inference \nmethods, Img2ST-Net employs a fully convolutional architecture to generate \ndense, HD gene expression maps in a parallelized manner. By modeling HD ST data \nas super-pixel representations, the task is reformulated from image-to-omics \ninference into a super-content image generation problem with hundreds or \nthousands of output channels. This design not only improves computational \nefficiency but also better preserves the spatial organization intrinsic to \nspatial omics data. To enhance robustness under sparse expression patterns, we \nfurther introduce SSIM-ST, a structural-similarity-based evaluation metric \ntailored for high-resolution ST analysis.\nRESULTS: Evaluations on two public Visium HD datasets at 8 and 16\u2009\u2009\u03bcm \nresolutions demonstrate that Img2ST-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods in \nboth accuracy and spatial coherence. On the Breast Cancer dataset at 16\u2009\u2009\u03bcm , \nImg2ST-Net achieves a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.1657 and a structural \nsimilarity index of 0.0937, whereas on the Colorectal Cancer dataset, it reaches \nan MSE of 0.\n\n---\n\n[Yuankai Huo 2024, PMID:40800538]\nTitle: Few sex differences in regional gray matter volume growth trajectories across early childhood.\nFull Text (excerpt): # Paper 40800538\n\n**Professor:** Huo\n**PMID:** 40800538\n\n## Full Text\n\nResearch Article\nFew sex differences in regional gray matter volume growth trajectories\nacross early childhood\nMadison Longa,b,c,d, Curtis Ostertaga,b,c,d, Jess E.

However, sex differ-\nences in gray matter structural development in early childhood are less studied. We characterized sex-\u00adspecific trajec-\ntories of gray matter volume development in children aged 2\u2013\u00ad8 years. We acquired anatomical magnetic resonance\nimaging (MRI) of the brain at the Alberta Children's Hospital in 123 typically developing children. Most children were\nscanned multiple times, for a total of 393 scans (mean = 3.2 scans/subject). We segmented T1-\u00adweighted structural\nMRI with MaCRUISE to define 116 regions and measured both absolute volumes (mm3) and proportional volumes\n(percent of intracranial volume). We characterized growth trajectories of gray matter volume for these brain regions\nbetween 2 and 8 years using mixed-\u00adeffects models, showing volume increases, with most posterior and temporo-\u00ad\nparietal regions peaking before 8 years. We found widespread main effects of sex, with males having larger volumes\nin 86% of brain regions. However, there were no significant sex differences in trajectories (age or age2 terms) for\nabsolute volume. Proportional volumes of the right occipital fusiform gyrus and left medial postcentral gyrus showed\nsignificant age-\u00adby-\u00adsex interactions where females had steeper volume decreases than males. This study also con-\nfirms regional patterns observed in previous studies of older children, such as posterior-\u00adto-\u00adanterior timing of brain\nmaturation. These results provide a comprehensive picture of gray matter volume development across early child-\nhood, and suggest that sex differences do not emerge until later in development.\nKeywords: brain development, structural MRI, gray matter volume, development trajectories, early childhood, sex\ndifferences\n1.

This poses limitations for opportunistic CT-based body composition\n(BC) assessment as key anatomical structures are missing. Traditionally, extending the FOV of\nCT is considered as a CT reconstruction problem using limited data. However, this approach\nrelies on the projection domain data which might not be available in application. In this work,\nwe formulate the problem from the semantic image extension perspective which only requires\nimage data as inputs. The proposed two-stage method identifies a new FOV border based on the\nAuthor Manuscript\nestimated extent of the complete body and imputes missing tissues in the truncated region. The\ntraining samples are simulated using CT slices with complete body in FOV, making the model\ndevelopment self-supervised. We evaluate the validity of the proposed method in automatic BC\nassessment using lung screening CT with limited FOV. The proposed method effectively restores\nthe missing tissues and reduces BC assessment error introduced by FOV tissue truncation. In\nthe BC assessment for large-scale lung screening CT datasets, this correction improves both the\nintra-subject consistency and the correlation with anthropometric approximations.

To the best of our knowledge, this is\nthe first work that integrates multi-atlas segmentation for splenomegaly as seen on MRI. To\naddress the particular concerns of spleen MRI, automated and novel semi-automated atlas\nselection approaches are introduced. The automated approach interactively selects a subset of\natlases using selective and iterative method for performance level estimation (SIMPLE) approach.\nTo further control the outliers, semi-automated craniocaudal length based SIMPLE atlas selection\n(L-SIMPLE) is proposed to introduce a spatial prior in a fashion to guide the iterative atlas\nselection. A dataset from a clinical trial containing 55 MRI volumes (28 T1 weighted and 27 T2\nweighted) was used to evaluate different methods. Both automated and semi-automated methods\nachieved median DSC > 0.9. The outliers were alleviated by the L-SIMPLE (\u22481 min manual\nefforts per scan), which achieved 0.9713 Pearson correlation compared with the manual\nAuthor Manuscript\nsegmentation. The results demonstrated that the multi-atlas segmentation is able to achieve\naccurate spleen segmentation from the multi-contrast splenomegaly MRI scans.\n1.

In order to account for the\nbias and spatial smoothing, we propose a feature-based unbiased average template surface. In\nAuthor Manuscript\ncontrast to prior approaches, we factor in the sample population covariance and assign weights\nbased on feature information to minimize the influence of covariance in the sampled population.\nThe mean surface is computed by applying the weights obtained from an inverse covariance\nmatrix, which guarantees that multiple representations from similar groups (e.g., involving\nimaging, demographic, diagnosis information) are down-weighted to yield an unbiased mean in\nfeature space. Results are validated by applying this approach in two different applications. For\nevaluation, the proposed unbiased weighted surface mean is compared with un-weighted means\nboth qualitatively and quantitatively (mean squared error and absolute relative distance of both the\nmeans with baseline). In first application, we validated the stability of the proposed optimal mean\non a scan-rescan reproducibility dataset by incrementally adding duplicate subjects. In the second\napplication, we used clinical research data to evaluate the difference between the weighted and\nunweighted mean when different number of subjects were included in control versus\nAuthor Manuscript\nschizophrenia groups. In both cases, the proposed method achieved greater stability that indicated\nreduced impacts of sampling bias. The weighted mean is built based on covariance information in\nfeature space as opposed to spatial location, thus making this a generic approach to be applicable\nto any feature of interest.\nKeywords\nGray matter cortical surface; unbiased template; cortical surface feature space\nPa\n\nGenerate a hypothesis that addresses what is NOT covered by any paper but could be addressed by combining their approaches.\n\nFormat your response as:\n<think>\n[Step-by-step reasoning about the gap]\n</think>\n\nHYPOTHESIS: [One sentence]\nRATIONALE: [Why novel and feasible]\nMETHODS: [Specific approach with datasets]\nEXPECTED OUTCOME: [Testable prediction with metrics]\n\nIMPORTANT: Cite papers as [Author Year, PMID:XXXXX].

Given the efficacy of membrane proteins as therapeutic targets in human malignancies, we examined cell-surface receptors that may act as drivers of lung tumorigenesis. Here, we report that the PROTOCADHERIN PCDH7 is overexpressed frequently in NSCLC tumors where this event is associated with poor clinical outcome. PCDH7 overexpression synergized with EGFR and KRAS to induce MAPK signaling and tumorigenesis. Conversely, PCDH7 depletion suppressed ERK activation, sensitized cells to MEK inhibitors, and reduced tumor growth. PCDH7 potentiated ERK signaling by facilitating interaction of protein phosphatase PP2A with its potent inhibitor, the SET oncoprotein. By establishing an oncogenic role for PCDH7 in lung tumorigenesis, our results provide a rationale to develop novel PCDH7 targeting therapies that act at the cell surface of NSCLC cells to compromise their growth.

The cause of relapse is thought to be from the persistence of leukemia initiating cells (LIC's) following treatment. Here we assessed RNA based changes in LICs from matched patient diagnosis and relapse samples using single-cell RNA sequencing. Previous studies on AML progression have focused on genetic changes at the DNA mutation level mostly in bulk AML cells and demonstrated the existence of DNA clonal evolution. Here we identified in LICs that the phenomenon of RNA clonal evolution occurs during AML progression. Despite the presence of vast transcriptional heterogeneity at the single cell level, pathway analysis identified common signaling networks involving metabolism, apoptosis and chemokine signaling that evolved during AML progression and become a signature of relapse samples. A subset of this gene signature was validated at the protein level in LICs by flow cytometry from an independent AML cohort and functional studies were performed to demonstrate co-targeting BCL2 and CXCR4 signaling may help overcome therapeutic challenges with AML heterogeneity. It is hoped this work will facilitate a greater understanding of AML relapse leading to improved prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic strategies to target LIC's.\n\nGenerate a hypothesis that addresses what is NOT covered by any paper but could be addressed by combining their approaches.\n\nFormat your response as:\n<think>\n[Step-by-step reasoning about the gap]\n</think>\n\nHYPOTHESIS: [One sentence]\nRATIONALE: [Why novel and feasible]\nMETHODS: [Specific approach with datasets]\nEXPECTED OUTCOME: [Testable prediction with metrics]\n\nIMPORTANT: Cite papers as [Author Year, PMID:XXXXX].

Symptoms of EoE include difficulty swallowing, food impaction, and chest\npain which significantly impact the quality of life, resulting in nutritional impairments, social\nAuthor Manuscript\nlimitations, and psychological distress. The diagnosis of EoE is typically performed with a\nthreshold (15 to 20) of eosinophils (Eos) per high-power field (HPF). Since the current counting\nprocess of Eos is a resource-intensive process for human pathologists, automatic methods\nare desired. Circle representation has been shown as a more precise, yet less complicated,\nrepresentation for automatic instance cell segmentation such as CircleSnake approach. However,\nthe CircleSnake was designed as a single-label model, which is not able to deal with multi-label\nscenarios. In this paper, we propose the multi-label CircleSnake model for instance segmentation\non Eos. It extends the original CircleSnake model from a single-label design to a multi-label\nmodel, allowing segmentation of multiple object types.

This discovery also aligns with the conclusion in prior work [48]. Meanwhile, some methods achieve competitive performance in some datasets (obviously above average) but almost fail (obviously below the average) in other datasets, for example reverse distillation, skipGanomaly and uniAD, etc. This may be due to their sensitivity to specific image scales or anomaly patterns, or reliance on features not well-suited to some datasets. Since we did not fine-tune hyperparameters for each method and dataset, the exact reasons behind these differences remain to be further explored. Overall, feature distribution-based anomaly detection methods outperform both distillation-based and reconstruction-based approaches, achieving higher object-level ROC-AUC averages when using the complete validation set for epoch selection (distribution-based approaches: 0.692, distillation-based: 0.600, reconstruction-based approaches: 0.564). This trend is especially notable for pathology-type images and has also been observed in Lagogiannis et al [9]. Reconstruction-based methods are often limited by the unpredictable generalization. Sometimes anomalous images are reconstructed well, while some normal images are rendered overly blurry. Given the abundance of fine-grained patterns in pathology images, feature-based anomaly detection is often more robust than pixel-based error or variance metrics. Unlike distillation-based methods, which compress features through a teacher-student framework, distribution-based approaches model the feature space extracted from normal images directly. These methods typically preserve richer detail in the original feature space, making them more sensitive to subtle or unstructured anomaly patterns. Also, the average ROC-AUC for industrial device datasets is significantly higher than that for synthetic datasets and much higher than for real pathology datasets. This highlights the complexity and challenges associated with pathology images, particularly real pathology images. Methods that perform well on industrial datasets may not be sufficient to effectively distinguish between normal and abnormal cases in digital pathology images.\n\nData will be provided after satisfying Vanderbilt University and Vanderbilt University Medical Center\u2019s data use agreement.\n\n## RESULTS\n\n\n\nResults of experiments are shown in tables 3 and 4.\n\nExperiment results (ROC-AUC): this table presents the performance of various anomaly detection methods under different epoch selection strategies across multiple datasets. The four strategies include: sample-wise best epoch selection (sample), best epoch based on the full validation set (val), epoch with the minimum training loss (loss), and the final epoch (last).

A recent study by McMaster, et al. showed that complex graph measures of the connectome, the graphical representation of a tractogram, vary with spatial sampling changes, but biases introduced by anisotropic voxels in the process have not been well characterized. This study uses microstructural measures (fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity) and white matter bundle properties (bundle volume, length, and surface area) to further understand the effect of anisotropic voxels on microstructure and tractography. METHODS: The statistical significance of the selected measures derived from dMRI data were assessed by comparing three white matter bundles at different spatial resolutions with 44 subjects from the Human Connectome Project - Young Adult dataset scan/rescan data using the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test. The original isotropic resolution (1.25\u00a0mm isotropic) was explored with 6 anisotropic resolutions with 0.25\u00a0mm incremental steps in the z dimension. Then, all generated resolutions were upsampled to 1.25\u00a0mm isotropic and 1\u00a0mm isotropic. RESULTS: There were statistically significant differences between at least one microstructural and one bundle measure at every resolution (p\u22640.05, corrected for multiple comparisons). Cohen's d coefficient evaluated the effect size of anisotropic voxels on microstructure and tractography. CONCLUSION: Fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity cannot be recovered with basic up-sampling from low quality data with gold-standard data with the methods selected for this study. However, the bundle measures across our selected regions of interest become more repeatable when voxels are resampled to 1\u00a0mm isotropic.\n\n---\n\n[Bennett Landman 2020, PMID:31093673]\nTitle: Brainstem Functional Connectivity Disturbances in Epilepsy may Recover After Successful Surgery.\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Focal seizures in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) are associated with widespread brain network perturbations and neurocognitive problems. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether brainstem connectivity disturbances improve with successful epilepsy surgery, as recent work has demonstrated decreased brainstem connectivity in TLE that is related to disease severity and neurocognitive profile. METHODS: We evaluated 15 adult TLE patients before and after (>1 yr; mean, 3.4 yr) surgery, and 15 matched control subjects using magnetic resonance imaging to measure functional and structural connectivity of ascending reticular activating system (ARAS) structures, including cuneiform/subcuneiform nuclei (CSC), pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN), and ventral tegmental area (VTA). RESULTS: TLE patients who achieved long-term postoperative seizure freedom (10 of 15) demonstrated increases in functional connectivity between ARAS structures and fronto-parietal-insular neocortex compared to preoperative baseline (P\u00a0=\u00a0.01, Kruskal-Wallis), with postoperative connectivity patterns resembling controls' connectivity. No functional connectivity changes were detected in 5 patients with persistent seizures after surgery (P\u00a0=\u00a0.9, Kruskal-Wallis). Among seizure-free postoperative patients, larger increases in CSC, PPN, and VTA functional connectivity were observed in individuals with more frequent seizures before surgery (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05 for each, Spearman's rho). Larger postoperative increases in PPN functional connectivity were seen in patients with lower baseline verbal IQ (P\u00a0=\u00a0.03, Spearman's rho) or verbal memory (P\u00a0=\u00a0.04, Mann-Whitney U). No changes in ARAS structural connectivity were detected after successful surgery. CONCLUSION: ARAS functional connectivity disturbances are present in TLE but may recover after successful epilepsy surgery. Larger increases in postoperative connectivity may be seen in individuals with more severe disease at baseline.\n\n---\n\n[Bennett Landman 2017, PMID:28448683]\nTitle: Magnetic resonance imaging connectivity for the prediction of seizure outcome in temporal lobe epile\nAbstract: OBJECTIVE: Currently, approximately 60-70% of patients with unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) remain seizure-free 3 years after surgery. The goal of this work was to develop a presurgical connectivity-based biomarker to identify those patients who will have an unfavorable seizure outcome 1-year postsurgery. METHODS: Resting-state functional and diffusion-weighted 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was acquired from 22 unilateral (15 right, 7 left) patients with TLE and 35 healthy controls. A seizure propagation network was identified including ipsilateral (to seizure focus) and contralateral hippocampus, thalamus, and insula, with bilateral midcingulate and precuneus. Between each pair of regions, functional connectivity based on correlations of low frequency functional MRI signals, and structural connectivity based on streamline density of diffusion MRI data were computed and transformed to metrics related to healthy controls of the same age. RESULTS: A consistent connectivity pattern representing the network expected in patients with seizure-free outcome was identified using eight patients who were seizure-free at 1-year postsurgery. The hypothesis that increased similarity to the model would be associated with better seizure outcome was tested in 14 other patients (Engel class IA, seizure-free: n = 5; Engel class IB-II, favorable: n = 4; Engel class III-IV, unfavorable: n = 5) using two similarity metrics: Pearson correlation and Euclidean distance. The seizure-free connectivity model successfully separated all the patients with unfavorable outcome from the seizure-free and favorable outcome patients (p = 0.0005, two-tailed Fisher's exact test) through the combination of the two similarity metrics with 100% accuracy. No other clinical and demographic predictors were successful in this regard. SIGNIFICANCE: This work introduces a methodologic framework to assess individual patients, and demonstrates the ability to use network connectivity as a potential clinical tool for epilepsy surgery outcome prediction after more comprehensive validation.\n\nIdentify a SHARED limitation and propose how to address it.\n\nFormat your response as:\n<think>\n[Analysis of each paper's limitations]\n[Identification of shared weakness]\n</think>\n\nSHARED LIMITATION: [What's missing across all papers]\nPROPOSED EXTENSION: [How to fix it]\nMETHODS: [Implementation approach]\nEXPECTED OUTCOME: [How this improves on current work]\n\nIMPORTANT: Cite papers as [Author Year, PMID:XXXXX].

However, a significant challenge has arisen due to the highly variable, convoluted cortical folding patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel topological graph representation for automatic sulcal curve extraction (TRACE). In practice, the reconstructed surface suffers from noise influences introduced during image acquisition/surface reconstruction. In the presence of noise on the surface, TRACE determines stable sulcal fundic regions by employing the line simplification method that prevents the sulcal folding pattern from being significantly smoothed out. The sulcal curves are then traced over the connected graph in the determined regions by the Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. For validation, we used the state-of-the-art surface reconstruction pipelines on a reproducibility data set. The experimental results showed higher reproducibility and robustness to noise in TRACE than the existing method (Li et al. 2010) with over 20% relative improvement in error for both surface reconstruction pipelines. In addition, the extracted sulcal curves by TRACE were well-aligned with manually delineated primary sulcal curves. We also provided a choice of parameters to control quality of the extracted sulcal curves and showed the influences of the parameter selection on the resulting curves.\n\n---\n\n[Hirak Sarkar 2021, PMID:33471073]\nTitle: Compression of quantification uncertainty for scRNA-seq counts.\nAbstract: MOTIVATION: Quantification estimates of gene expression from single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data have inherent uncertainty due to reads that map to multiple genes. Many existing scRNA-seq quantification pipelines ignore multi-mapping reads and therefore underestimate expected read counts for many genes. alevin accounts for multi-mapping reads and allows for the generation of 'inferential replicates', which reflect quantification uncertainty. Previous methods have shown improved performance when incorporating these replicates into statistical analyses, but storage and use of these replicates increases computation time and memory requirements. RESULTS: We demonstrate that storing only the mean and variance from a set of inferential replicates ('compression') is sufficient to capture gene-level quantification uncertainty, while reducing disk storage to as low as 9% of original storage, and memory usage when loading data to as low as 6%. Using these values, we generate 'pseudo-inferential' replicates from a negative binomial distribution and propose a general procedure for incorporating these replicates into a proposed statistical testing framework. When applying this procedure to trajectory-based differential expression analyses, we show false positives are reduced by more than a third for genes with high levels of quantification uncertainty. We additionally extend the Swish method to incorporate pseudo-inferential replicates and demonstrate improvements in computation time and memory usage without any loss in performance. Lastly, we show that discarding multi-mapping reads can result in significant underestimation of counts for functionally important genes in a real dataset. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: makeInfReps and splitSwish are implemented in the R/Bioconductor fishpond package available at https://bioconductor.org/packages/fishpond.

A recent systematic review found little consistency or agreement on how primary contact clinics are evaluated. The concept of value of primary contact clinics, which has important implications for evaluation, has not yet been explored in-depth. To explore allied health clinicians' perceptions of the value of allied health primary contact clinics, with the goal of informing an evaluation framework, a descriptive qualitative approach utilizing semi-structured interviews was employed. Participants included allied health staff embedded in clinical lead roles within primary contact clinics across four acute care hospitals in a metropolitan health service located in South-East Queensland, Australia. Lead staff from 30 identified primary contact clinic models in the health service were approached to take part via email. All eligible participants who provided consent were included. An inductive thematic analysis approach was used. A total of 23 clinicians (n\u2009=\u200923) representing 22 diverse models of primary contact clinics participated. Most participants were physiotherapists, dietitians, or occupational therapists, although speech pathology, audiology, and podiatry were also represented. Participant perceptions of the 'value' of PCCs were a highly complex phenomenon, comprising five intersecting domains: (i) patient satisfaction; (ii) clinical outcomes; (iii) care pathway and resource use; (iv) health service performance; and (v) staff satisfaction and professional standing. These five core value domains were positively or negatively influenced by 12 perceived benefits and 8 perceived drawbacks, respectively. Value domains were also highly interrelated and impacted upon each other. The concept of 'value' relating to primary contact clinics involves multiple intersecting domains encompassing different perspectives. This study highlighted potential benefits and drawbacks of primary contact clinics that have not yet been measured or explored in the literature, and as such may be useful for healthcare administrators to consider. The findings of this study will inform an evaluation framework including health economics calculator for primary contact clinics.\n\nPropose a novel method combining techniques from at least 2 papers.\n\nFormat your response as:\n<think>\n[Step-by-step reasoning about how methods complement each other]\n</think>\n\nHYPOTHESIS: [Novel combined approach]\nRATIONALE: [Why combining is beneficial]\nMETHODS: [Technical details of integration]\nEXPECTED OUTCOME: [Performance improvements expected]\n\nIMPORTANT: Cite papers as [Author Year, PMID:XXXXX].

The complex kidney system comprises various\ncomponents across multiple levels, including regions (cortex, medulla), functional units\n(glomeruli, tubules), and cells (podocytes, mesangial cells in glomerulus). Prior studies have\npredominantly overlooked the intricate spatial interrelations among objects from clinical\nknowledge. In this research, we introduce a novel universal proposition learning approach,\nAuthor Manuscript\ncalled panoramic renal pathology segmentation (PrPSeg), designed to segment comprehensively\npanoramic structures within kidney by integrating extensive knowledge of kidney anatomy.\nIn this paper, we propose (1) the design of a comprehensive universal proposition matrix for\nrenal pathology, facilitating the incorporation of classification and spatial relationships into the\nsegmentation process; (2) a token-based dynamic head single network architecture, with the\nimprovement of the partial label image segmentation and capability for future data enlargement;\nand (3) an anatomy loss function, quantifying the inter-object relationships across the kidney.\n1.

In the clinical anatomy of renal pathology, there are different levels of quantification\nnecessary for disease diagnosis [42], severity recognition [34], and treatment effectiveness\nevaluation [28], ranging from region-level objects (like medulla and cortex) to functional\nunits (glomerulus, tubules, vessels, etc.) and even to individual cells within these units.\nThese tasks, especially at the functional unit and cell levels, are prone to errors and\nvariability in human examination and require labor-intensive efforts [26, 47, 53].

There is currently no suitable neuropsychological assessment scale to effectively identify MCI in neurological outpatient departments in China. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) is often used to screen for MCI in outpatient departments in China.To compare the value of Mini-Cog and MMSE in screening patients for MCI in a neurological outpatient department, and determine differences in the value of Mini-Cog for different ages and educational levels.This was a retrospective study of 229 patients with suspected MCI who visited the Cangzhou Central Hospital between March 2012 and April 2016. The MCI group included 119 patients diagnosed with MCI and 110 cases without MCI (non-MCI group). The MCI patients were subgrouped as 40 to 60 years of age, 61 to 80 years, and >80 years; and as without education, \u22646 years education, and >6 years education. All subjects were assessed using the Mini-Cog and MMSE.There were significant differences in Mini-Cog (P\u200a<\u200a.05) and MMSE (P\u200a<\u200a.05) between the MCI and non-MCI groups. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and Youden index (85.71%, 79.41%, 0.8108, 0.8438, and 0.6550) of Mini-Cog were all higher than those of MMSE (64.76%, 71.57%, 0.7010, 0.6364, and 0.3370) in identifying MCI, but there was no significant difference in specificity (P\u200a>\u200a.05). Mini-Cog was better than MMSE (P\u200a<\u200a.05) for MCI patients with different ages and education levels.These results showed that the Mini-Cog was superior to MMSE in identifying MCI patients. Mini-Cog was less affected by age and education level than MMSE. The Mini-Cog assessment was short (3-4\u200aminutes) and easily accepted by the patients. Mini-Cog could be more suitable for application in outpatient department in primary hospitals.\n\nGenerate a hypothesis that addresses what is NOT covered by any paper but could be addressed by combining their approaches.\n\nFormat your response as:\n<think>\n[Step-by-step reasoning about the gap]\n</think>\n\nHYPOTHESIS: [One sentence]\nRATIONALE: [Why novel and feasible]\nMETHODS: [Specific approach with datasets]\nEXPECTED OUTCOME: [Testable prediction with metrics]\n\nIMPORTANT: Cite papers as [Author Year, PMID:XXXXX].

Nonetheless, many patients receiving CD19 CAR-T cells fail to respond for unknown reasons. To reveal changes in 4-1BB-based CD19 CAR-T cells and identify biomarkers of response, we used single-cell RNA sequencing and protein surface marker profiling of patient CAR-T cells pre- and postinfusion into patients with NHL. At the transcriptional and protein levels, we note the evolution of CAR-T cells toward a nonproliferative, highly differentiated, and exhausted state, with an enriched exhaustion profile in CAR-T cells of patients with poor response marked by TIGIT expression. Utilizing in vitro and in vivo studies, we demonstrate that TIGIT blockade alone improves the antitumor function of CAR-T cells. Altogether, we provide evidence of CAR-T cell dysfunction marked by TIGIT expression driving a poor response in patients with NHL. SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first study investigating the mechanisms linked to CAR-T patient responses based on the sequential analysis of manufactured and infused CAR-T cells using single-cell RNA and protein expression data. Furthermore, our findings are the first to demonstrate an improvement of CAR-T cell efficacy with TIGIT inhibition alone.

Purpose: Recent developments in computational pathology have been driven by\nadvances in vision foundation models (VFMs), particularly the Segment Anything\nModel (SAM). This model facilitates nuclei segmentation through two primary meth-\nods: prompt-based zero-shot segmentation and the use of cell-specific SAM models\nfor direct segmentation. These approaches enable effective segmentation across\na range of nuclei and cells. However, general VFMs often face challenges with\nfine-grained semantic segmentation, such as identifying specific nuclei subtypes\nor particular cells.\nApproach: In this paper, we propose the molecular empowered all-in-SAM model\nto advance computational pathology by leveraging the capabilities of VFMs. This\nmodel incorporates a full-stack approach, focusing on (1) annotation\u2014engaging\nlay annotators through molecular empowered learning to reduce the need for\ndetailed pixel-level annotations, (2) learning\u2014adapting the SAM model to empha-\nsize specific semantics, which utilizes its strong generalizability with SAM adapter,\nand (3) refinement\u2014enhancing segmentation accuracy by integrating molecular\noriented corrective learning.\nResults: Experimental results from both in-house and public datasets show that\nthe all-in-SAM model significantly improves cell classification performance, even\nwhen faced with varying annotation quality.\nConclusions: Our approach not only reduces the workload for annotators but also\nextends the accessibility of precise biomedical image analysis to resource-limited\nsettings, thereby advancing medical diagnostics and automating pathology image\nanalysis.\n\u00a9 The Authors.

Conventional spot-by-spot sequential regression frameworks \nbecome inefficient and unstable at this scale, whereas the inherent extreme \nsparsity and low expression levels of high-resolution ST further complicate both \nprediction and evaluation.\nAPPROACH: To address these limitations, we propose Img2ST-Net, a high-definition \n(HD) histology-to-ST generation framework for efficient and parallel \nhigh-resolution ST prediction. Unlike conventional spot-by-spot inference \nmethods, Img2ST-Net employs a fully convolutional architecture to generate \ndense, HD gene expression maps in a parallelized manner. By modeling HD ST data \nas super-pixel representations, the task is reformulated from image-to-omics \ninference into a super-content image generation problem with hundreds or \nthousands of output channels. This design not only improves computational \nefficiency but also better preserves the spatial organization intrinsic to \nspatial omics data. To enhance robustness under sparse expression patterns, we \nfurther introduce SSIM-ST, a structural-similarity-based evaluation metric \ntailored for high-resolution ST analysis.\nRESULTS: Evaluations on two public Visium HD datasets at 8 and 16\u2009\u2009\u03bcm \nresolutions demonstrate that Img2ST-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods in \nboth accuracy and spatial coherence. On the Breast Cancer dataset at 16\u2009\u2009\u03bcm , \nImg2ST-Net achieves a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.1657 and a structural \nsimilarity index of 0.0937, whereas on the Colorectal Cancer dataset, it reaches \nan MSE of 0.\n\nGenerate a hypothesis that addresses what is NOT covered by any paper but could be addressed by combining their approaches.\n\nFormat your response as:\n<think>\n[Step-by-step reasoning about the gap]\n</think>\n\nHYPOTHESIS: [One sentence]\nRATIONALE: [Why novel and feasible]\nMETHODS: [Specific approach with datasets]\nEXPECTED OUTCOME: [Testable prediction with metrics]\n\nIMPORTANT: Cite papers as [Author Year, PMID:XXXXX].

With a \ntenet of \"seeing is believing\", MxIF enables iterative staining and imaging \nextensive antibodies, which provides comprehensive biomarkers to segment and \ngroup different cells on a single tissue section. However, considerable \ndepletion of the scarce tissue is inevitable from extensive rounds of staining \nand bleaching (\"missing tissue\"). Moreover, the immunofluorescence (IF) imaging \ncan globally fail for particular rounds (\"missing stain\"). In this work, we \nfocus on the \"missing stain\" issue. It would be appealing to develop digital \nimage synthesis approaches to restore missing stain images without losing more \ntissue physically. Herein, we aim to develop image synthesis approaches for \neleven MxIF structural molecular markers (i.e., epithelial and stromal) on real \nsamples. We propose a novel multi-channel high-resolution image synthesis \napproach, called pixN2N-HD, to tackle possible missing stain scenarios via a \nhigh-resolution generative adversarial network (GAN). Our contribution is \nthree-fold: (1) a single deep network framework is proposed to tackle missing \nstain in MxIF; (2) the proposed \"N-to-N\" strategy reduces theoretical four years \nof computational time to 20 hours when covering all possible missing stains \nscenarios, with up to five missing stains (e.g., \"(N-1)-to-1\", \"(N-2)-to-2\"); \nand (3) this work is the first comprehensive experimental study of investigating \ncross-stain synthesis in MxIF.

Variations in\nbody size, position, and relative organ positions greatly complicate the segmentation process.\nHistorically, multi-atlas methods have achieved leading results across imaging modalities and\nanatomical targets. However, deep learning is rapidly overtaking classical approaches for image\nAuthor Manuscript\nsegmentation. Recently, Zhou et al. showed that fully convolutional networks produce excellent\nresults in abdominal organ segmentation of computed tomography (CT) scans. Yet, deep learning\napproaches have not been applied to whole abdomen magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\nsegmentation. Herein, we evaluate the applicability of an existing fully convolutional neural\nnetwork (FCNN) designed for CT imaging to segment abdominal organs on T2 weighted (T2w)\nMRI\u2019s with two examples. In the primary example, we compare a classical multi-atlas approach\nwith FCNN on forty-five T2w MRI\u2019s acquired from splenomegaly patients with five organs\nlabeled (liver, spleen, left kidney, right kidney, and stomach).

Measuring AI in bulk data lacking time or spatial resolution has the limitation that cell-type-specific (CTS), spatial- or time-dependent AI signals may be dampened or not detected. RESULTS: We introduce a statistical method airpart for identifying differential CTS AI from single-cell RNA-sequencing data, or dynamics AI from other spatially or time-resolved datasets. airpart outputs discrete partitions of data, pointing to groups of genes and cells under common mechanisms of cis-genetic regulation. In order to account for low counts in single-cell data, our method uses a Generalized Fused Lasso with Binomial likelihood for partitioning groups of cells by AI signal, and a hierarchical Bayesian model for AI statistical inference. In simulation, airpart accurately detected partitions of cell types by their AI and had lower Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of allelic ratio estimates than existing methods. In real data, airpart identified differential allelic imbalance patterns across cell states and could be used to define trends of AI signal over spatial or time axes.

For example, widespread hemodynamic fluctuations across the brain have\nbeen found to correlate with natural, low-frequency variations in the depth and rate of breathing\nover time. Acquiring peripheral measures of respiration during fMRI scanning not only allows for\nmodeling such effects in fMRI analysis, but also provides valuable information for interrogating\nbrain-body physiology. However, physiological recordings are frequently unavailable or have\ninsufficient quality. Here, we propose a computational technique for reconstructing continuous\nlow-frequency respiration volume (RV) fluctuations from fMRI data alone. We evaluate the\nperformance of this approach across different fMRI preprocessing strategies. Further, we\ndemonstrate that the predicted RV signals can account for similar patterns of temporal variation in\nresting-state fMRI data compared to measured RV fluctuations. These findings indicate that\nAuthor Manuscript\nfluctuations in respiration volume can be extracted from fMRI alone, in the common scenario of\nmissing or corrupted respiration recordings.

Many current bacteria detection technologies are inconvenient and time-consuming, making them unsuitable for field detection. New technology based on the CRISPR/Cas system has the potential to fill the existing gaps in detection. The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) system is a part of the bacterial adaptive immune system to protect them from intruding bacteriophages. The immunological memory is saved by the CRISPR array of bacteria in the form of short DNA sequences (spacers) from invading viruses and incorporated with the CRISPR DNA repeats. Cas proteins are responsible for triggering and initiating the adaptive immune function of CRISPR/Cas systems. In advanced biological research, the CRISPR/Cas system has emerged as a significant tool from genome editing to pathogen detection. By considering its sensitivity and specificity, this system can become one of the leading detection methods for targeting DNA/RNA. This technique is well applied in virus detection like Dengue, ZIKA, SARS-CoV-2, etc., but for bacterial detection, this CRISPR/Cas system is limited to only a few organisms to date. In this review, we have discussed the different techniques based on the CRISPR/Cas system that have been developed for the detection of various pathogenic bacteria like \n\n---\n\n[Yuankai Huo 2022, PMID:35531320]\nTitle: Inpainting Missing Tissue in Multiplexed Immunofluorescence Imaging.\nFull Text (excerpt): # Paper 35531320\n\n**Professor:** Huo\n**PMID:** 35531320\n\n## Full Text\n\nHHS Public Access\nAuthor manuscript\nProc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng.

In this work,\nwe investigate the feasibility of employing generative adversarial network (GAN) approaches\nto synthesize missing tissues using 11 MxIF structural molecular markers (i.e., epithelial and\nstromal). Briefly, we integrate a multi-channel high-resolution image synthesis approach to\nsynthesize the missing tissue from the remaining markers. The performance of different methods\nis quantitatively evaluated via the downstream cell membrane segmentation task.

While the number of these international competitions is steadily increasing, surprisingly little effort has been invested in ensuring high quality design, execution and reporting for these international competitions. Specifically, results analysis and visualization in the event of uncertainties have been given almost no attention in the literature. Given these shortcomings, the contribution of this paper is two-fold: (1) we present a set of methods to comprehensively analyze and visualize the results of single-task and multi-task challenges and apply them to a number of simulated and real-life challenges to demonstrate their specific strengths and weaknesses; (2) we release the open-source framework challengeR as part of this work to enable fast and wide adoption of the methodology proposed in this paper. Our approach offers an intuitive way to gain important insights into the relative and absolute performance of algorithms, which cannot be revealed by commonly applied visualization techniques. This is demonstrated by the experiments performed in the specific context of biomedical image analysis challenges. Our framework could thus become an important tool for analyzing and visualizing challenge results in the field of biomedical image analysis and beyond.\n\nPropose a novel method combining techniques from at least 2 papers.\n\nFormat your response as:\n<think>\n[Step-by-step reasoning about how methods complement each other]\n</think>\n\nHYPOTHESIS: [Novel combined approach]\nRATIONALE: [Why combining is beneficial]\nMETHODS: [Technical details of integration]\nEXPECTED OUTCOME: [Performance improvements expected]\n\nIMPORTANT: Cite papers as [Author Year, PMID:XXXXX].

This study examined associations between baseline structural neuroimaging markers and longitudinal functional status. METHODS: Linear mixed effects models with follow-up time interaction terms related baseline grey matter volume and white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) to functional trajectory, adjusting for demographic and medical covariates. Subsequent models assessed interactions with cognitive status and apolipoprotein E (APOE) \u03b54 status. RESULTS: Smaller baseline grey matter volumes, particularly in regions commonly affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD), and greater baseline WMHs were associated with faster functional decline over a mean 5-year follow-up. Effects were stronger in APOE-\u03b54 carriers on grey matter variables. Cognitive status interacted with most MRI variables. DISCUSSION: Greater atrophy in AD-related regions and higher WMH burden at study entry were associated with faster functional decline, particularly among participants at increased risk of AD.\n\n---\n\n[Bennett Landman 2018, PMID:29526642]\nTitle: Empirical reproducibility, sensitivity, and optimization of acquisition protocol, for Neurite Orient\nAbstract: Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI) has been gaining prominence for estimating multiple diffusion compartments from MRI data acquired in a clinically feasible time. To establish a pathway for adoption of NODDI in clinical studies, it is important to understand the sensitivity and reproducibility of NODDI metrics on empirical data in the context of acquisition protocol and brain anatomy. Previous studies addressed reproducibility across the 3\u202fT scanners and within session and between subject reproducibility at 1.5\u202fT and 3\u202fT. However, empirical reproducibility on the performance of NODDI metrics based on b-value and diffusion-sensitized directions has not yet been addressed.

All experiments were performed on a 3.0T whole body MR scanner (Philips dStream Ingenia, Best, Netherlands). A two-channel body coil was used for excitation and a 16-channel SENSE neurovascular coil was used for reception. The maximum gradient strength of the system was 80 mT/m at a slew rate of 100 mT/m/s. All data were acquired under a protocol approved by the local institutional review board (IRB #111087) and informed consent was obtained prior to the study.\n\nBrain imaging consisted of a T1-weighted image using a three-dimensional (3D) T1-MPRAGE image (TR = 6.3 ms, inversion time = 1060 ms, TE = 2.9 ms, flip angle 8 degrees, spatial resolution 1 x 1 x 1 mm3, acquisition time = 5 m 37 s). The diffusion protocol consisted of a pulsed-gradient spin-echo sequence with single-shot echo planar imaging (EPI) readout with the following parameters: repetition time 4400 ms, echo time 100 ms, pulse duration 24 ms, pulse separation 60 ms, spatial resolution 2.5 x 2.5 x 2.5 mm3, 62 slices, whole-brain coverage, axial orientation, SENSE = 2.2, multiband = 2, partial Fourier = 0.70, with 7 (non-zero) b-values of 0/100/500/1000/2000/3000/4000/6000 with 22/8/8/16/24/32/40/48 measurements per shell, acquired with phase encoding in the anterior-posterior direction, with a scan of 6 b = 0 s/mm2 images with reversed phase encoding. The total scan time for brain diffusion data was 16.5 min. We note that the sequence was separated into three sequential acquisitions, with constant pre-scan settings, because the software did not allow >128 diffusion-weighted volumes in a single acquisition. Scans were simply concatenated prior to preprocessing (mrcat from MRTrix3 (Tournier et al., 2019) tools).\n\nCord imaging consisted of a high-resolution (0.65 \u00d7 0.65 \u00d7 5 mm3) multi-slice, multi-echo gradient echo (mFFE) anatomical image (Held et al., 2003) (TR/TE/\u0394TE = 753/7.1/8.8 ms, \u03b1 = 28\u00b0, number of slices = 14, 6:12 min) for co-registration and to serve as a reference image for segmentation. The diffusion protocol was matched to the brain, and consisted of a pulsed-gradient spin-echo sequence with single-shot EPI readout with the following parameters: repetition time 4400 ms, echo time 100 ms, pulse duration 24 ms, pulse separation 51 ms, spatial resolution 1.1 x 1.1 x 5 mm3, 18 slices, axial orientation, SENSE = 1.8, multiband = none, partial Fourier = 0.69, with 7 (non-zero) b-values of 0/100/500/1000/2000/3000/4000/6000 with 22/8/8/16/24/32/40/48 gradient directions performed per shell, acquired with phase encoding in the left\u2013right direction, with a scan of 6 b =0 s/mm2 images with reversed phase encoding. All images were centered at the C3/C4 intervertebral disk. Reduced field-of-view was applied using an outer volume suppression technique (Wilm et al., 2007) and fat suppression was achieved using SPIR.

This study aims to identify the genetic architecture of limbic WM \nmicrostructure in older adults by leveraging harmonized data from multiple \ncohorts, including those enriched for cognitively impaired individuals.\nMETHODS: We analyzed diffusion MRI (dMRI) data from 2,614 non-Hispanic White \nolder adults (mean age = 73.7 \u00b1 9.8 years; 57% female; 26% cognitively impaired) \nacross 7 harmonized aging cohorts. WM microstructure was assessed in 7 limbic \ntracts, including the cingulum, fornix, inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), \nuncinate fasciculus (UF), and transcallosal tracts of the inferior, middle, and \nsuperior temporal gyri (ITG, MTG, STG) using advanced diffusion MRI metrics \ncorrected for free-water (FW): fractional anisotropy (FA FWcorr ), axial \ndiffusivity (AxD FWcorr ), mean diffusivity (MD FWcorr ), radial diffusivity (RD \nFWcorr ). We performed heritability estimations, genome-wide association studies \n(GWAS) and post-GWAS analyses (genetic covariance, gene-level and pathway \nanalysis, transcriptome-wide association [TWAS] studies). The AD relevance of \nthe discovered variants was explored using bulk RNA-seq data from caudate, \ndorsolateral prefrontal, and posterior cingulate cortex human brain tissues.\nRESULTS: Limbic WM microstructure demonstrated significant heritability \n(estimates between 0.26 and 0.60, p FDR < 0.05 for 15 of 35 \ntract-by-microstructure combinations). GWAS identified 6 genome-wide significant \nloci ( p < 5.0\u00d710 -8 ) associated with WM microstructure.

Recent advances in data driven\nmethods have enabled direct comparison and optimization of methods for in-vivo data with\nexternally validated histological sections with both 2-D and 3-D histology. Yet, all existing\nmethods make limiting assumptions of either (1) model-based linkages between b-values or (2)\nlimited associations with single shell data. We generalize prior deep learning models that used\nAuthor Manuscript\nsingle shell spherical harmonic transforms to integrate the recently developed simple harmonic\noscillator reconstruction (SHORE) basis. To enable learning on the SHORE manifold, we present\nan alternative formulation of the fiber orientation distribution (FOD) object using the SHORE\nbasis while representing the observed diffusion weighted data in the SHORE basis. To ensure\nconsistency of hyper-parameter optimization for SHORE, we present our Deep SHORE approach\nto learn on a data-optimized manifold. Deep SHORE is evaluated with eight-fold cross-validation\nof a preclinical MRI-histology data with four b-values. Generalizability of in-vivo human data is\nevaluated on two separate 3T MRI scanners. Specificity in terms of angular correlation (ACC)\nwith the preclinical data improved on single shell: 0.78 relative to 0.73 and 0.73, multi-shell: 0.80\nrelative to 0.74 (p < 0.001). In the in-vivo human data, Deep SHORE was more consistent across\nscanners with 0.63 relative to other multi-shell methods 0.39, 0.52 and 0.57 in terms of ACC. In\nconclusion, Deep SHORE is a promising method to enable data driven learning with DW-MRI\nAuthor Manuscript\nunder conditions with varying b-values, number of diffusion shells, and gradient directions per\nshell.\nKeywords\nDeep Learning; Orthonormal Basis; SHORE; Spherical Harmonics\nvishwesh.nath@vanderbilt.edu.\nNath et al.

Moreover, even\noptimal surface registration does not necessarily produce optimal cortical parcellation as parcel\nboundaries are not fully matched to the geometric features. In this context, a choice of training\nfeatures is important for accurate cortical parcellation. To utilize the networks efficiently, we\nAuthor Manuscript\npropose cortical parcellation-specific input data from an irregular and complicated structure of\ncortical surfaces. To this end, we align ground-truth cortical parcel boundaries and use their\nresulting deformation fields to generate new pairs of deformed geometric features and parcellation\nmaps. To extend the capability of the networks, we then smoothly morph cortical geometric\nfeatures and parcellation maps using the intermediate deformation fields. We validate our method\non 427 adult brains for 49 labels.

However, their ability to elucidate detailed functional characteristics of diverse cellular phenotypes within tumor immune microenvironment (TME) is limited. We aimed to enhance our understanding of cellular composition and functional characteristics across TME regions and improve patient stratification by integrating H&E with adjacent immunohistochemistry (IHC) images. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on patients with Human Papillomavirus-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC). Using paired H&E and IHC slides for 11 proteins, a deep learning pipeline was used to quantify tumor, stroma, and TILs in the TME. Patients were classified into immune inflamed (IN), immune excluded (IE), or immune desert (ID) phenotypes. By registering the IHC and H&E slides, we integrated IHC data to capture protein expression in the corresponding tumor regions. We further stratified patients into specific immune subtypes, such as IN, with increased or reduced CD8+ cells, based on the abundance of these proteins. This characterization provided functional insight into the H&E-based subtypes. RESULTS: Analysis of 88 primary tumors and 70 involved lymph node tissue images reveals an improved prognosis in patients classified as IN in primary tumors with high CD8 and low CD163 expression (p\u2009=\u20090.007). Multivariate Cox regression analysis confirms a significantly better prognosis for these subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: Integrating H&E and IHC data enhances the functional characterization of immune phenotypes of the TME with biological interpretability, and improves patient stratification in HPV(\u2009+\u2009) OPSCC. In this study, we investigated whether differences in the immune cell population surrounding head and neck cancers impact disease progression. We used advanced computer programs to analyze tissue samples from tumors and nearby lymph nodes, a part of the immune system. These tumor and lymph node samples were stained to show the structure of the tissue and to identify the different types of immune cells present. We grouped patients into different categories based on differences in their immune cells. We found that patients with certain patterns of immune cells tended to have better outcomes. This method could help doctors predict how well patients will respond to treatments.\n\n---\n\n[Yuankai Huo 2021, PMID:33957555]\nTitle: Default mode network connectivity and cognition in the aging brain: the effects of age, sex, and APOE genotype.\nFull Text (excerpt): # Paper 33957555\n\n**Professor:** Huo\n**PMID:** 33957555\n\n## Full Text\n\nHHS Public Access\nAuthor manuscript\nNeurobiol Aging.

The American College of Radiology Data Science Institute has identified more than 240 specific use cases\nwhere AI could be used to improve clinical practice. In this context, thousands of potential methods are developed by research\nlabs and industry innovators. Deploying AI tools within a clinical enterprise, even on limited retrospective evaluation, is\ncomplicated by security and privacy concerns. Thus, innovation must be weighed against the substantive resources required\nfor local clinical evaluation. To reduce barriers to AI validation while maintaining rigorous security and privacy standards,\nwe developed the AI Imaging Incubator.

Each cohort required demographic and clinical covariates, including age, sex, educational attainment, self-reported race and ethnicity, APOE haplotype status, and cognitive status (cognitively unimpaired, mild cognitive impairment, dementia due to AD), with cohort-specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. Additional cohort details can be found in the eMethods in Supplement 1. The current study was conducted from June 2024 to February 2025. Participants were included in this study if they had dMRI, cognitive composite, demographic, and clinical data, were aged 50 years or older, and passed neuroimaging quality control. All participants provided written informed consent, and research was conducted under institutional review board\u2013approved protocols. The Vanderbilt University Medical Center Institutional Review Board approved secondary analysis of these data, and we followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guidelines.\n\nNeuropsychological data were independently collected for each cohort and harmonized using established procedures.21 Experts assigned test items to memory, executive function, language, or visuospatial domains or none of these. Investigators ensured consistent scoring of anchor items\u2014tests were administered and scored identically across cohorts. Anchor items had identical parameters across studies, while parameters for other items (nonanchor and nonidentical candidate anchor items) were freely estimated in confirmatory bifactor models. Parameters from all available items were used to score each participant at each time point, and z-score cognitive composites were created. Full details on all cognitive composites can be found in the original study by Mukherjee et al.21 The current study focused on cross-sectional and longitudinal memory, executive function, and language performance.\n\nAll data were preprocessed using the PreQual pipeline, which is an automated pipeline that corrects dMRI data for susceptibility-induced motion, geometric distortion, and eddy current effect-induced artifacts, performs intervolume registration to alleviate participant head motion, denoises, and imputes signal dropout in a slicewise manner.22,23,24\n\n---\n\n[Yuankai Huo 2024, PMID:39169060]\nTitle: Identification and multimodal characterization of a specialized epithelial cell type associated with Crohn's disease.\nFull Text (excerpt): ## METHODS\n\n\n\nThe study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Written informed consent was obtained from non-IBD control and CD subjects to obtain serum samples, as well as, terminal ileum (TI) and ascending colon (AC) tissues at the time of scheduled endoscopic procedures. TI and AC tissues from non-IBD control and CD subjects undergoing surgical resection were also obtained from under a separate IRB protocol in coordination with the Comparative Human Tissue Network (CHTN). All samples were obtained as a part of the clinical trial \u201cCombinatorial Single Cell Strategies for a Crohn\u2019s Disease Gut Cell Atlas\u201d, identifier NCT04113733 (clinicaltrials.gov).\n\nBetween December 2019 and January 2022, endoscopy subjects were prospectively recruited in the IBD clinic or GI endoscopy unit at Vanderbilt University Medical Center prior to colonoscopy for CD disease activity assessment or non-IBD indications including colorectal cancer screening or polyp surveillance. Surgical resection subjects were those undergoing resection for CD-related complications or other non-inflammatory indications, including endoscopically unresectable polyps. Patient participation in the current study ended after serum and/or tissue samples were obtained. Exclusion criteria for the study were: pregnancy, known coagulopathy or bleeding disorders, known renal or hepatic impairment, history of organ transplantation, or inability to give informed consent. After appropriate exclusions, there were 65 CD subjects with varying disease activity and 18 non-IBD controls.\n\nFor all participants, demographics including age, gender, medical history, and medication use were determined from participant reporting and review of the electronic medical record. Serum samples were obtained at the time of colonoscopy and were snap frozen with dry ice and then stored at \u221280\u2009\u00b0C39,67. Tissue biopsies for research purposes in the TI and AC were obtained as follows: fresh tissue biopsies were placed in chelation buffer (4\u2009mM EDTA, 0.5\u2009mM DTT in DPBS) for further processing and scRNAseq analysis, and an adjacent set of tissue biopsies were formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) for research blocks. 5\u2009\u00b5m sections were used from each FFPE block and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and examined in a blinded manner by a gastrointestinal pathologist (MKW) and graded accordingly as: inactive (normal_CD, quiescent) or active (mild, moderate, or severe activity). All associated study data were collected and managed using Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) electronic data capture tools hosted at Vanderbilt68,69, including Clinical Data Interoperability Services, such as Clinical Data Pull70 and e-consent71.\n\nSingle-cell RNA-sequencing was performed on human biopsies and surgical specimens72,73.

In addition, we proposed a local cache system to reduce interaction times with REDCap for large-scale data records. Experimental setups include assessing barcode recognition accuracy under various levels of image blurring, showcasing different study types managed with the organ-specific archive, and measuring system throughput and response times with and without the proposed local cache system.\n\nIn this section, we detail the development and evaluation processes designed to meet the 3 proposed design criteria: improving barcode robustness, incorporating a dynamic organ-specific archive, and optimizing system throughput. Each methodology and experimental setup ensures the solutions are effective and practical for real-life clinical settings.\n\nThe data management workflow for 2 Python-based applications from [20], the Printer app and the Data entry app, which are integral components of our biopsy management with REDCap, is presented in Figure 2(A-B).\n\nBriefly, the Printer app workflow begins by entering the patient ID, which autofills the patient group based on control or study or disease-related subgroups. Next, the clinician ID is selected, and a print option is chosen, ranging from default to including extra frozen biopsies. The \u201cBarcode Printing\u201d step, highlighted in a green box in Figure 2, was identified as a bottleneck due to limitations in printer quality and previously selected barcode design. Finally, print events are synced to REDCap, ensuring all printed barcodes are recorded in the system.\n\nThe data entry app workflow starts by scanning the barcode and selecting the clinician ID. If samples are collected, the user enters the sample location information and selects the organ information, both highlighted in yellow boxes in Figure 2. The previous system could only handle one static organ selection, which was a limitation given the diverse clinical studies we manage. If samples are not collected, the barcode is marked as not collected, and the relevant REDCap field is removed. Syncing sample archive information to REDCap, highlighted in a red box in Figure 2, is where the interaction bottleneck was found, which is critical for optimizing system throughput.\n\nNext, we introduce design criteria based on the 3 identified bottlenecks in detail.\n\nTo address the issue of barcode robustness, a series of validations (Figure 3) was conducted to assess various barcode technologies and printing methods for decoding 8-digit numerical data [20] (necessitated by the limitations of printer quality and the tiny barcode size).

However, clinically routine modalities such as imaging and diagnostic codes can be asynchronous and irregularly sampled over different time scales which are obstacles to longitudinal multimodal learning. In this work, we propose a transformer-based multimodal strategy to integrate repeat imaging with longitudinal clinical signatures from routinely collected EHRs for SPN classification. We perform unsupervised disentanglement of latent clinical signatures and leverage time-distance scaled self-attention to jointly learn from clinical signatures expressions and chest computed tomography (CT) scans. Our classifier is pretrained on 2,668 scans from a public dataset and 1,149 subjects with longitudinal chest CTs, billing codes, medications, and laboratory tests from EHRs of our home institution. Evaluation on 227 subjects with challenging SPNs revealed a significant AUC improvement over a longitudinal multimodal baseline (0.824 vs 0.752 AUC), as well as improvements over a single cross-section multimodal scenario (0.809 AUC) and a longitudinal imaging-only scenario (0.741 AUC). This work demonstrates significant advantages with a novel approach for co-learning longitudinal imaging and non-imaging phenotypes with transformers.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We model a disease source as an unobserved root node in the causal graph of observed EHR variables (laboratory test results, medication exposures, billing codes, and demographics), and a signature as the set of downstream effects that a given source has on those observed variables. We used probabilistic independence to infer 2000 sources and their signatures from 9195 variables in 630,000 cross-sectional training instances sampled at random times from 269,099 longitudinal patient records. We evaluated the learned sources by using them to infer and explain the causes of benign vs. malignant pulmonary nodules in 13,252 records, comparing the inferred causes to an external reference list and other medical literature. We compared models trained by three different algorithms and used corresponding models trained directly from the observed variables as baselines. RESULTS: The model recovered 92% of malignant and 30% of benign causes in the reference standard. Of the top 20 inferred causes of malignancy, 14 were not listed in the reference standard, but had supporting evidence in the literature, as did 11 of the top 20 inferred causes of benign nodules. The model decomposed listed malignant causes by an average factor of 5.5 and benign causes by 4.1, with most stratifying by disease course or treatment regimen. Predictive accuracy of causal predictive models trained on source expressions (Random Forest AUC 0.788) was similar to (p = 0.058) their associational baselines (0.738). DISCUSSION: Most of the unrecovered causes were due to the rarity of the condition or lack of sufficient detail in the input data. Surprisingly, the causal model found many patients with apparently undiagnosed cancer as the source of the malignant nodules. Causal model AUC also suggests that some sources remained undiscovered in this cohort. CONCLUSION: These promising results demonstrate the potential of using probabilistic independence to disentangle complex clinical signatures from noisy, asynchronous, and incomplete EHR data that represent the confluence of multiple simultaneous conditions, and to identify patient-specific causes that support precise treatment decisions.\n\n---\n\n[Bennett Landman 2022, PMID:36303581]\nTitle: Mapping the Impact of Non-Linear Gradient Fields on Diffusion MRI Tensor Estimation.\nAbstract: Non-linear gradients impact diffusion weighted (DW) MRI by corrupting the experimental setup and lead to problems during image encoding including the effects in-plane distortion, in-plane shifts, intensity modulations and phase errors. Recent studies have been shown this may present significant complication in the interpretation of results and conclusion while studying tractography and tissue microstructure in data. To interpret the degree in consequences of gradient non-linearities between the desired and achieved gradients, we introduced empirically derived gradient nonlinear fields at different orientations and different tensor properties. The impact is assessed through diffusion tensor properties including mean diffusivity (MD), fractional anisotropy (FA) and principal eigen vector (PEV). The study shows lower FA are more susceptible to LR fields and LR fields with determinant <1 or >1 corrupt tensor more. The corruption can result in significantly different FA based on true-FA and LR field. Apparent MD decreases for negative determinant, on the other hand positive determinant shows the opposite effect. LR field have a larger impact on PEV when FA value is small. The results are dependent on the underlying orientation, non-linear field corruption can cause both increase and decrease of estimated FA, MD and PEV value. This work provides insight into characterizing the non-linear gradient error and aid in selecting correction techniques to address the inaccuracies in b-values.\n\nIdentify a SHARED limitation and propose how to address it.\n\nFormat your response as:\n<think>\n[Analysis of each paper's limitations]\n[Identification of shared weakness]\n</think>\n\nSHARED LIMITATION: [What's missing across all papers]\nPROPOSED EXTENSION: [How to fix it]\nMETHODS: [Implementation approach]\nEXPECTED OUTCOME: [How this improves on current work]\n\nIMPORTANT: Cite papers as [Author Year, PMID:XXXXX].

The RAG approach [External/Polymath 2024, PMID:jbhi.2025.3641931] retrieves clinical guidelines for diagnosis but lacks molecular grounding.

(3) Apply anchor concept from Sarkar: identify \"anchor\" patients with both single-cell profiles and rich clinical annotation, use these to bridge queries from molecular to clinical space. (4) Track provenance: for each molecular-clinical link, maintain evidence chain (which papers, which datasets). (5) Validate by testing if retrieved clinical evidence correctly predicts patient outcomes given their single-cell profile.\n\nEXPECTED OUTCOME: Given a tumor single-cell profile, the system should retrieve relevant clinical trials (precision@10 > 0.7 for trials with matching molecular inclusion criteria), prognostic literature, and treatment guidelines. Confidence calibration should show that self-consistency scores correlate with actual clinical relevance (Spearman rho > 0.5).

This study assessed if LV mass index related to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of microglial activation (sTREM2 [soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2]), axonal injury (NFL [neurofilament light]), neurodegeneration (total-tau), and amyloid-\u03b2, and whether these biomarkers partially accounted for associations between increased LV mass index and white matter damage. We hypothesized higher LV mass index would relate to greater CSF biomarker levels, and these pathologies would partially mediate associations with cerebral white matter microstructure.

However, to preserve patient anonymity it is frequently impractical or prohibited to transfer protected health information (PHI) between institutions. Additionally, due to the nature of some studies, there may not be a large public dataset available on which to train models. To address this conundrum, we analyze the efficacy of transferring the model itself in lieu of data between different sites. By doing so we accomplish two goals: 1) the model gains access to training on a larger dataset that it could not normally obtain and 2) the model better generalizes, having trained on data from separate locations. In this paper, we implement multi-site learning with disparate datasets from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) without compromising PHI. Three neural networks are trained to convergence on a computed tomography (CT) brain hematoma segmentation task: one only with NIH data, one only with VUMC data, and one multi-site model alternating between NIH and VUMC data. Resultant lesion masks with the multi-site model attain an average Dice similarity coefficient of 0.64 and the automatically segmented hematoma volumes correlate to those done manually with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.87, corresponding to an 8% and 5% improvement, respectively, over the single-site model counterparts.\n\n---\n\n[Bennett Landman 2023, PMID:37123016]\nTitle: Deep whole brain segmentation of 7T structural MRI.\nAbstract: 7T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has the potential to drive our understanding of human brain function through new contrast and enhanced resolution. Whole brain segmentation is a key neuroimaging technique that allows for region-by-region analysis of the brain. Segmentation is also an important preliminary step that provides spatial and volumetric information for running other neuroimaging pipelines. Spatially localized atlas network tiles (SLANT) is a popular 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) tool that breaks the whole brain segmentation task into localized sub-tasks. Each sub-task involves a specific spatial location handled by an independent 3D convolutional network to provide high resolution whole brain segmentation results. SLANT has been widely used to generate whole brain segmentations from structural scans acquired on 3T MRI. However, the use of SLANT for whole brain segmentation from structural 7T MRI scans has not been successful due to the inhomogeneous image contrast usually seen across the brain in 7T MRI. For instance, we demonstrate the mean percent difference of SLANT label volumes between a 3T scan-rescan is approximately 1.73%, whereas its 3T-7T scan-rescan counterpart has higher differences around 15.13%. Our approach to address this problem is to register the whole brain segmentation performed on 3T MRI to 7T MRI and use this information to finetune SLANT for structural 7T MRI. With the finetuned SLANT pipeline, we observe a lower mean relative difference in the label volumes of ~8.43% acquired from structural 7T MRI data. Dice similarity coefficient between SLANT segmentation on the 3T MRI scan and the after finetuning SLANT segmentation on the 7T MRI increased from 0.79 to 0.83 with p<0.01. These results suggest finetuning of SLANT is a viable solution for improving whole brain segmentation on high resolution 7T structural imaging.\n\nGenerate a hypothesis that addresses what is NOT covered by any paper but could be addressed by combining their approaches.\n\nFormat your response as:\n<think>\n[Step-by-step reasoning about the gap]\n</think>\n\nHYPOTHESIS: [One sentence]\nRATIONALE: [Why novel and feasible]\nMETHODS: [Specific approach with datasets]\nEXPECTED OUTCOME: [Testable prediction with metrics]\n\nIMPORTANT: Cite papers as [Author Year, PMID:XXXXX].

Deep neural networks have been used\nfor performing sematic segmentation in medical imaging perspective with 2D images or 3D\npatches, such as DeepLab [3], UNet [4] and VoxResNet [5]. Current major challenges of\nabdominal organ segmentation are: 1) weak intensity boundaries between abdominal organs,\n2) large morphological variation of different organs, and 3) high resolution of 3D volumes.\n7.COMPLIANCE WITH ETHICAL STANDARDS\nThis study was performed in line with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.

While our prior work has evaluated \nearly-generation AI cell foundation models in this domain, the effectiveness of \nrecent cell foundation models remains unclear. In this study, we benchmark \nadvanced AI cell foundation models (2025), including CellViT++ variants and \nCellpose-SAM, against three widely used cell foundation models developed prior \nto 2024, using a diverse large-scale set of kidney image patches within a \nhuman-in-the-loop rating framework. We further performed fusion-based ensemble \nevaluation and model agreement analysis to assess the segmentation capabilities \nof the different models. Our results show that CellViT++ [Virchow] yields the \nhighest standalone performance with 40.3% of predictions rated as \"Good\" on a \ncurated set of 2,091 challenging samples, outperforming all prior models. In \naddition, our fused model achieves 62.2% \"Good\" predictions and only 0.4% \"Bad\", \nsubstantially reducing segmentation errors. Notably, the fusion model (2025) \nsuccessfully resolved the majority of challenging cases that remained \nunaddressed in our previous study. These findings demonstrate the potential of \nAI cell foundation model development in renal pathology and provide a curated \ndataset of challenging samples to support future kidney-specific model \nrefinement.\n\nPMCID: PMC12622189\nPMID: 41256883\n\n---\n\n[Yuankai Huo 2022, PMID:36304178]\nTitle: Multi-modal Learning with Missing Data for Cancer Diagnosis Using Histopathological and Genomic Data.\nFull Text (excerpt): # Paper 36304178\n\n**Professor:** Huo\n**PMID:** 36304178\n\n## Full Text\n\nU.S. Department of Veterans Affairs\nPublic Access Author manuscript\nProc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng.

The eXtensible Neuroimaging Archive Toolkit (XNAT) is one of several platforms that seeks to solve the storage issues. Distributed Automation for XNAT (DAX) is a job control and distribution manager. Recent massive data projects have revealed several bottlenecks for projects with >100,000 assessors (i.e., data processing pipelines in XNAT). In order to address these concerns, we have developed a new API, which exposes a direct connection to the database rather than REST API calls to accomplish the generation of assessors. This method, consistent with XNAT, keeps a full history for auditing purposes. Additionally, we have optimized DAX to keep track of processing status on disk (called DISKQ) rather than on XNAT, which greatly reduces load on XNAT by vastly dropping the number of API calls. Finally, we have integrated DAX into a Docker container with the idea of using it as a Docker controller to launch Docker containers of image processing pipelines. Using our new API, we reduced the time to create 1,000 assessors (a sub-cohort of our case project) from 65040 seconds to 229 seconds (a decrease of over 270 fold). DISKQ, using pyXnat, allows launching of 400 jobs in under 10 seconds which previously took 2,000 seconds. Together these updates position DAX to support projects with hundreds of thousands of scans and to run them in a time-efficient manner.\n\n---\n\n[Bennett Landman 2022, PMID:36196360]\nTitle: Anomalous and heterogeneous characteristics of the BOLD hemodynamic response function in white matte\nAbstract: Detailed knowledge of the BOLD hemodynamic response function (HRF) is crucial for accurate analyses and interpretation of functional MRI data. Considerable efforts have been made to characterize the HRF in gray matter (GM), but much less attention has been paid to BOLD effects in white matter (WM). However, several recent reports have demonstrated reliable detection and analyses of WM BOLD signals both after stimulation and in a resting state. WM and GM differ in composition, energy requirements, and blood flow, so their neurovascular couplings also may well be different. We aimed to derive a comprehensive characterization of the HRF in WM across a population, including accurate measurements of its shape and its variation along and between WM pathways, using resting-state fMRI acquisitions. Our results show that the HRF is significantly different between WM and GM. Features of the HRF, such as a prominent initial dip, show strong relationships with features of the tissue microstructure derived from diffusion imaging, and these relationships differ between WM and GM, consistent with BOLD signal fluctuations reflecting different energy demands and neurovascular couplings in tissues of different composition and function. We also show that the HRF varies in shape significantly along WM pathways and is different between different WM pathways, suggesting the temporal evolution of BOLD signals after an event vary in different parts of the WM. These features of the HRF in WM are especially relevant for interpretation of the biophysical basis of BOLD effects in WM.\n\n---\n\n[Bennett Landman 2024, PMID:39220213]\nTitle: Assessment of Subject Head Motion in Diffusion MRI.\nAbstract: Subject head motion during the acquisition of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) of the brain induces artifacts and affects image quality. Information about the frequency and extent of motion could reveal which aspects of motion correction are most necessary. Therefore, we investigate the extent of translation and rotation among participants, and how the motion changes during the scan acquisition. We analyze 5,380 DWI scans from 1,034 participants. We measure the rotations and translations in the sagittal, coronal and transverse planes needed to align the volumes to the first and previous volumes, as well as the displacement. The different types of motion are compared with each other and compared over time. The largest rotation (per minute) is around the right - left axis (median 0.378 \u00b0/min, range 0.000 - 11.466\u00b0) and the largest translation (per minute) is along the anterior - posterior axis (median 1.867 mm/min, range 0.000 - 10.944 mm). We additionally observe that spikes in movement occur at the beginning of the scan, particularly in anterior - posterior translation. The results show that all scans are affected by subtle head motion, which may impact subsequent image analysis.\n\nPropose a novel method combining techniques from at least 2 papers.\n\nFormat your response as:\n<think>\n[Step-by-step reasoning about how methods complement each other]\n</think>\n\nHYPOTHESIS: [Novel combined approach]\nRATIONALE: [Why combining is beneficial]\nMETHODS: [Technical details of integration]\nEXPECTED OUTCOME: [Performance improvements expected]\n\nIMPORTANT: Cite papers as [Author Year, PMID:XXXXX].

In order to manually trace these structures, a combination of high-resolution and specialized sequences at 7T are used, but it is not feasible to scan clinical patients in those scanners. Targeted imaging sequences at 3T such as F-GATIR, and other optimized inversion recovery sequences, have been presented which enhance contrast in a select group of these structures. In this work, we show that a series of atlases generated at 7T can be used to accurately segment these structures at 3T using a combination of standard and optimized imaging sequences, though no one approach provided the best result across all structures. In the thalamus and putamen, a median Dice coefficient over 0.88 and a mean surface distance less than 1.0mm was achieved using a combination of T1 and an optimized inversion recovery imaging sequences. In the internal and external globus pallidus a Dice over 0.75 and a mean surface distance less than 1.2mm was achieved using a combination of T1 and F-GATIR imaging sequences. In the substantia nigra and sub-thalamic nucleus a Dice coefficient of over 0.6 and a mean surface distance of less than 1.0mm was achieved using the optimized inversion recovery imaging sequence. On average, using T1 and optimized inversion recovery together produced significantly improved segmentation results than any individual modality (p<0.05 wilcox sign-rank test).\n\n---\n\n[Bennett Landman 2021, PMID:34358660]\nTitle: Fiber tractography bundle segmentation depends on scanner effects, vendor effects, acquisition resol\nAbstract: When investigating connectivity and microstructure of white matter pathways of the brain using diffusion tractography bundle segmentation, it is important to understand potential confounds and sources of variation in the process. While cross-scanner and cross-protocol effects on diffusion microstructure measures are well described (in particular fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity), it is unknown how potential sources of variation effect bundle segmentation results, which features of the bundle are most affected, where variability occurs, nor how these sources of variation depend upon the method used to reconstruct and segment bundles. In this study, we investigate six potential sources of variation, or confounds, for bundle segmentation: variation (1) across scan repeats, (2) across scanners, (3) across vendors (4) across acquisition resolution, (5) across diffusion schemes, and (6) across diffusion sensitization. We employ four different bundle segmentation workflows on two benchmark multi-subject cross-scanner and cross-protocol databases, and investigate reproducibility and biases in volume overlap, shape geometry features of fiber pathways, and microstructure features within the pathways. We find that the effects of acquisition protocol, in particular acquisition resolution, result in the lowest reproducibility of tractography and largest variation of features, followed by vendor-effects, scanner-effects, and finally diffusion scheme and b-value effects which had similar reproducibility as scan-rescan variation. However, confounds varied both across pathways and across segmentation workflows, with some bundle segmentation workflows more (or less) robust to sources of variation. Despite variability, bundle dissection is consistently able to recover the same location of pathways in the deep white matter, with variation at the gray matter/ white matter interface. Next, we show that differences due to the choice of bundle segmentation workflows are larger than any other studied confound, with low-to-moderate overlap of the same intended pathway when segmented using different methods. Finally, quantifying microstructure features within a pathway, we show that tractography adds variability over-and-above that which exists due to noise, scanner effects, and acquisition effects. Overall, these confounds need to be considered when harmonizing diffusion datasets, interpreting or combining data across sites, and when attempting to understand the successes and limitations of different methodologies in the design and development of new tractography or bundle segmentation methods.\n\n---\n\n[Bennett Landman 2019, PMID:30753960]\nTitle: White matter microstructure correlates of general and specific second-order factors of psychopatholo\nAbstract: Increasing data indicate that prevalent forms of psychopathology can be organized into second-order dimensions based on their correlations, including a general factor of psychopathology that explains the common variance among all disorders and specific second-order externalizing and internalizing factors. Nevertheless, most existing studies on the neural correlates of psychopathology employ case-control designs that treat diagnoses as independent categories, ignoring the highly correlated nature of psychopathology. Thus, for instance, although perturbations in white matter microstructure have been identified across a range of mental disorders, nearly all such studies used case-control designs, leaving it unclear whether observed relations reflect disorder-specific characteristics or transdiagnostic associations. Using a representative sample of 410 young adult twins oversampled for psychopathology risk, we tested the hypothesis that some previously observed relations between white matter microstructure properties in major tracts and specific disorders are related to second-order factors of psychopathology. We examined fractional anisotropy (FA), radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity (AD). White matter correlates of all second-order factors were identified after controlling for multiple statistical tests, including the general factor (FA in the body of the corpus callosum), specific internalizing (AD in the fornix), and specific externalizing (AD in the splenium of the corpus callosum, sagittal stratum, anterior corona radiata, and internal capsule). These findings suggest that some features of white matter within specific tracts may be transdiagnostically associated multiple forms of psychopathology through second-order factors of psychopathology rather with than individual mental disorders.\n\nGenerate a hypothesis that addresses what is NOT covered by any paper but could be addressed by combining their approaches.\n\nFormat your response as:\n<think>\n[Step-by-step reasoning about the gap]\n</think>\n\nHYPOTHESIS: [One sentence]\nRATIONALE: [Why novel and feasible]\nMETHODS: [Specific approach with datasets]\nEXPECTED OUTCOME: [Testable prediction with metrics]\n\nIMPORTANT: Cite papers as [Author Year, PMID:XXXXX].

To guide individualized patient care, a non-invasive means of distinguishing indolent from aggressive ADC subtypes is needed urgently. Computer-Aided Nodule Assessment and Risk Yield (CANARY) is a novel computed tomography (CT) tool that characterizes early ADCs by detecting nine distinct CT voxel classes, representing a spectrum of lepidic to invasive growth, within an ADC. CANARY characterization has been shown to correlate with ADC histology and patient outcomes. This study evaluated the inter-observer variability of CANARY analysis. Three novice observers segmented and analyzed independently 95 biopsy-confirmed lung ADCs from Vanderbilt University Medical Center/Nashville Veterans Administration Tennessee Valley Healthcare system (VUMC/TVHS) and the Mayo Clinic (Mayo). Inter-observer variability was measured using intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). The average ICC for all CANARY classes was 0.828 (95% CI 0.76, 0.895) for the VUMC/TVHS cohort, and 0.852 (95% CI 0.804, 0.901) for the Mayo cohort. The most invasive voxel classes had the highest ICC values. To determine whether nodule size influenced inter-observer variability, an additional cohort of 49 sub-centimeter nodules from Mayo were also segmented by three observers, with similar ICC results. Our study demonstrates that CANARY ADC classification between novice CANARY users has an acceptably low degree of variability, and supports the further development of CANARY for clinical application.\n\n---\n\n[Bennett Landman 2025, PMID:40352684]\nTitle: Cerebrospinal fluid YKL-40 relates to white matter hyperintensity progression in females but not mal\nFull Text (excerpt): ## METHODS\n\n\n\nHuman chitinase\u20103\u2010like protein\u20101 (YKL\u201040) concentrations at baseline were related to white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume, free water (FW), and FW\u2010corrected fractional anisotropy using linear effects models (for cross\u2010sectional outcomes) and linear mixed\u2010effects models (for longitudinal outcomes), adjusting for demographic and medical risk factors.

A major challenge to studying this is the relative paucity of datasets of patients with dementia, with/without HFpEF, and relevant neuroimaging. We sought to demonstrate the feasibility of using modern data mining tools to create and analyze clinical imaging datasets and identify the neuroanatomical signature of HFpEF-associated dementia. We leveraged the bioinformatics tools at Vanderbilt University Medical Center to identify patients with a diagnosis of dementia with and without comorbid HFpEF using the electronic health record. We identified high resolution, clinically-acquired neuroimaging data on 30 dementia patients with HFpEF (age 76.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.12\u00a0years, 61% female) as well as 301 age- and sex-matched patients with dementia but without HFpEF to serve as comparators (age 76.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.52\u00a0years, 60% female). We used automated image processing pipelines to parcellate the brain into 132 structures and quantify their volume. We found six regions with significant atrophy associated with HFpEF: accumbens area, amygdala, posterior insula, anterior orbital gyrus, angular gyrus, and cerebellar white matter. There were no regions with atrophy inversely associated with HFpEF. Patients with dementia and HFpEF have a distinct neuroimaging signature compared to patients with dementia only. Five of the six regions identified in are in the temporo-parietal region of the brain.

Diagnostics are needed for these patients. OBJECTIVE: To determine if a battery of assessments or machine-learning approaches can aid in diagnosing visual dysfunction in patients with mild TBI. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective, observational, case-control study was conducted between May 2018 and November 2021. The study setting was at a level 1 trauma research hospital. Participant eligibility included adult males and females with recorded best-corrected visual acuity and normal fundus examination. Individuals in the case group had a history of mild TBI; controls had no history of TBI. Exclusion criteria included a history of ocular, neurological, or psychiatric disease, moderate-severe TBI, recent TBI, metal implants, age younger than 18 years, and pregnancy. Cases and controls were sex- and age-matched. Data analysis was performed from July 2023 to March 2024. EXPOSURES: History of mild TBI in the case group. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The single-session visit included the Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory and measurements of oculomotor function, optical coherence tomography, contrast sensitivity, visual evoked potentials, visual field testing, and magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: A total of 28 participants (mean [SD] age, 35.0 [12.8] years; 15 male [53.6%]) with mild TBI and 28 controls (mean [SD] age, 35.8 [8.5] years; 19 female [67.9%]) were analyzed. Participants with mild TBI showed reduced prism convergence test breakpoint (-8.38; 95% CI, -14.14 to -2.62; P\u2009=\u2009.008) and recovery point (-8.44; 95% CI, -13.82 to -3.06; P\u2009=\u2009.004). Participants with mild TBI also had decreased contrast sensitivity (-0.07; 95% CI, -0.13 to -0.01; P\u2009=\u2009.04) and increased visual evoked potential binocular summation index (0.32; 95% CI, 0.02-0.63; P\u2009=\u2009.02). A subset of participants exhibited reduced peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, increased optic nerve/sheath size, and brain cortical volumes. Machine learning identified subtle differences across the primary visual pathway, including the optic radiations and occipital lobe regions, independent of visual symptoms. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Results of this case-control study suggest that the visual system was affected in individuals with mild TBI, even in those who did not self-report vision problems. These findings support the utility of a battery of assessments or machine-learning approaches to accurately diagnose this population.\n\n---\n\n[Bennett Landman 2024, PMID:38530135]\nTitle: Lung CT harmonization of paired reconstruction kernel images using generative adversarial networks.\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: The kernel used in CT image reconstruction is an important factor that determines the texture of the CT image. Consistency of reconstruction kernel choice is important for quantitative CT-based assessment as kernel differences can lead to substantial shifts in measurements unrelated to underlying anatomical structures. PURPOSE: In this study, we investigate kernel harmonization in a multi-vendor low-dose CT lung cancer screening cohort and evaluate our approach's validity in quantitative CT-based assessments. METHODS: Using the National Lung Screening Trial, we identified CT scan pairs of the same sessions with one reconstructed from a soft tissue kernel and one from a hard kernel. In total, 1000 pairs of five different paired kernel types (200 each) were identified. We adopt the pix2pix architecture to train models for kernel conversion. Each model was trained on 100 pairs and evaluated on 100 withheld pairs. A total of 10 models were implemented. We evaluated the efficacy of kernel conversion based on image similarity metrics including root mean squared error (RMSE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and structural similarity index measure (SSIM) as well as the capability of the models to reduce measurement shifts in quantitative emphysema and body composition measurements. Additionally, we study the reproducibility of standard radiomic features for all kernel pairs before and after harmonization. RESULTS: Our approach effectively converts CT images from one kernel to another in all paired kernel types, as indicated by the reduction in RMSE (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and an increase in the PSNR (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and SSIM (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) for both directions of conversion for all pair types. In addition, there is an increase in the agreement for percent emphysema, skeletal muscle area, and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) area for both directions of conversion. Furthermore, radiomic features were reproducible when compared with the ground truth features. CONCLUSIONS: Kernel conversion using deep learning reduces measurement variation in percent emphysema, muscle area, and SAT area.\n\n---\n\n[Bennett Landman 2022, PMID:34702069]\nTitle: Axonal Injury Partially Mediates Associations Between Increased Left Ventricular Mass Index and Whit\nAbstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Left ventricular (LV) mass index is a marker of subclinical LV remodeling that relates to white matter damage in aging, but molecular pathways underlying this association are unknown. This study assessed if LV mass index related to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of microglial activation (sTREM2 [soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2]), axonal injury (NFL [neurofilament light]), neurodegeneration (total-tau), and amyloid-\u03b2, and whether these biomarkers partially accounted for associations between increased LV mass index and white matter damage. We hypothesized higher LV mass index would relate to greater CSF biomarker levels, and these pathologies would partially mediate associations with cerebral white matter microstructure. METHODS: Vanderbilt Memory and Aging Project participants who underwent cardiac magnetic resonance, lumbar puncture, and diffusion tensor imaging (n=142, 72\u00b16 years, 37% mild cognitive impairment [MCI], 32%  RESULTS: Among all participants, LV mass index was unrelated to CSF biomarkers ( CONCLUSIONS: Subclinical cardiovascular remodeling, measured as an increase in LV mass index, is associated with neuroaxonal degeneration among individuals with MCI and \n\nIdentify a SHARED limitation and propose how to address it.\n\nFormat your response as:\n<think>\n[Analysis of each paper's limitations]\n[Identification of shared weakness]\n</think>\n\nSHARED LIMITATION: [What's missing across all papers]\nPROPOSED EXTENSION: [How to fix it]\nMETHODS: [Implementation approach]\nEXPECTED OUTCOME: [How this improves on current work]\n\nIMPORTANT: Cite papers as [Author Year, PMID:XXXXX].

State-of-the art distortion correction methods (for example, using FSL's topup or AFNI's 3dQwarp algorithms) require the collection of additional scans - either field maps or images with reverse phase encoding directions (i.e., blip-up/blip-down acquisitions) - to estimate and correct distortions. However, not all imaging protocols acquire these additional data and thus cannot take advantage of these post-acquisition corrections. In this study, we aim to enable state-of-the art processing of historical or limited datasets that do not include specific sequences for distortion correction by using only the acquired functional data and a single commonly acquired structural image. To achieve this, we synthesize an undistorted image with contrast similar to the fMRI data and use the non-distorted synthetic image as an anatomical target for distortion correction. We evaluate the efficacy of this approach, named SynBOLD-DisCo (Synthetic BOLD contrast for Distortion Correction), and show that this distortion correction process yields fMRI data that are geometrically similar to non-distorted structural images, with distortion correction virtually equivalent to acquisitions that do contain both blip-up/blip-down images.

Simulation and phantom-based studies suggest that QBI results are affected by the b-value, the number of diffusion weighting directions, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). However, optimal acquisition schemes for QBI in clinical settings are largely undetermined given empirical (observed) imaging considerations. In this study, we acquire a HARDI dataset at five b-values with 11 repetitions on a single subject to investigate the effects of acquisition scheme and subsequent analysis models on the accuracy and precision of measures of tissue composition and fiber orientation derived from clinically feasible QBI at 3T. Clinical feasibility entails short scan protocols - less than 5minutes in the current study - resulting in lower SNR, lower b-values, and fewer diffusion directions than are typical in most QBI protocols with research applications, where time constraints are less prevalent. In agreement with previous studies, we find that the b-value and number of diffusion directions impact the magnitude and variation of QBI indices in both white matter and gray matter regions; however, QBI indices are most heavily dependent on the maximum order of the spherical harmonic (SH) series used to represent the diffusion orientation distribution function (ODF). Specifically, to ensure numerical stability and reduce the occurrence of false peaks and inflated anisotropy, we recommend oversampling by at least 8-12 more diffusion directions than the number of estimated coefficients for a given SH order. In addition, in an equal scan time comparison of QBI accuracy, we find that increasing the directional resolution of the HARDI dataset is preferable to repeating observations; however, our results indicate that as few as 32 directions at a low b-value (1000s/mm\n\n---\n\n[Mary Kay Washington 2024, PMID:39427081]\nTitle: The reverse transsulfuration pathway affects the colonic microbiota and contributes to colitis in mice.\nAbstract: Cystathionine \u03b3-lyase (CTH) is a critical enzyme in the reverse transsulfuration pathway, the major route for the metabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids, notably converting cystathionine to cysteine.

We unravelled local and systemic immune profiles in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) by high-dimensional analysis to provide an unbiased characterisation of the immune contexture of CRC.

Recent studies have shown that frailty is associated with specific volumetric neuroimaging characteristics. Whether brain microstructural characteristics, particularly gray matter, associated with frailty exist and what their spatial distribution is have not been explored. We identified 670 participants of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging who were aged 60 and older and cognitively normal and who had concurrent data on frailty and regional microstructural neuroimaging markers by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), including mean diffusivity (MD) of gray matter and fractional anisotropy (FA) of white matter. We identified neuroimaging markers that were associated with frailty status (non-frail, pre-frail, frail) and further examined differences between three groups using multivariate linear regression (non-frail = reference). Models were adjusted for age, sex, race, years of education, body mass index, scanner type, and Apolipoprotein E e4 carrier status. Compared to the non-frail participants, those who were frail had higher MD in the medial frontal cortex, several subcortical regions (putamen, caudate, thalamus), anterior cingulate cortex, and a trend of lower FA in the body of the corpus callosum. Those who were pre-frail also had higher MD in the putamen and a trend of lower FA in the body of the corpus callosum. Our study demonstrates for the first time that the microstructure of both gray and white matter differs by frailty status in cognitively normal older adults. Brain areas were not widespread but mostly localized in frontal and subcortical motor areas and the body of the corpus callosum. Whether changes in brain microstructure precede future frailty development warrants further investigation.\n\n---\n\n[Yuankai Huo 2025, PMID:41001570]\nTitle: Fast Electromagnetic and RF Circuit Co-Simulation for Passive Resonator Field Calculation and Optimization in MRI.\nFull Text (excerpt): # Paper 41001570\n\n**Professor:** Huo\n**PMID:** 41001570\n\n## Full Text\n\nFast Electromagnetic and RF Circuit Co-Simulation for Passive\nResonator Field Calculation and Optimization in MRI\nZhonghao Zhanga,\u2217, Ming Lub,c,\u2217, Hao Liangb,c,\u2217, Zhongliang Zub,c , Yi Gud , Xiao Wange , Yuankai\nHuoa,f , John C.

How-\never, optimizing these structures using full-wave electromagnetic (EM) simulations is computationally\nprohibitive, particularly for massive-element passive resonator arrays with many degrees of freedom.\nMethods: While the EM and RF circuit co-simulation method has previously been applied to RF coil\ndesign, this work presents, for the first time, a co-simulation framework tailored specifically for the analy-\nsis and optimization of passive resonators. The framework performs a single full-wave EM simulation in\nwhich the resonator\u2019s lumped components are replaced by ports, followed by circuit-level computations\nto evaluate arbitrary capacitor/inductor configurations. This allows integration with a genetic algorithm\nto rapidly optimize the resonator parameters to enhance B1 fields in a targeted region of interest (ROI).\nResults: The proposed method was validated across three scenarios of increasing complexity: (1) a\nsingle-loop passive resonator on a spherical phantom, (2) a two-loop array on a cylindrical phantom,\nand (3) a two-loop array on a human head model. In all cases, the co-simulation results showed excel-\nlent agreement with full-wave EM simulations, with relative errors below 1%. The genetic-algorithm-\ndriven optimization, involving tens of thousands of capacitor combinations, completed in under 5 min-\nutes\u2014whereas equivalent full-wave EM sweeps would require an impractically long computation time.\nConclusion: This work extends co-simulation methodology to passive resonator design for the first time,\nenabling fast, accurate, and scalable optimization.

In computer vision, the end-to-end\ninstance segmentation methods (e.g., Mask-RCNN) have shown their advantages relative to\ndetect-then-segment approaches by performing complementary detection and segmentation\ntasks simultaneously. As a result, the end-to-end Mask-RCNN approach has been the de facto\nstandard method in recent glomerular segmentation studies, where downsampling and patch-\nbased techniques are used to properly evaluate the high-resolution images from WSI (e.g.,\n>10;000 \u00d7 10;000 pixels on 40\u00d7). However, in high-resolution WSI, a single glomerulus itself\ncan be more than 1000 \u00d7 1000 pixels in original resolution which yields significant information\nloss when the corresponding features maps are downsampled to the 28 \u00d7 28 resolution via the\nend-to-end Mask-RCNN pipeline.\nApproach: We assess if the end-to-end instance segmentation framework is optimal for high-\nresolution WSI objects by comparing Mask-RCNN with our proposed detect-then-segment\nframework. Beyond such a comparison, we also comprehensively evaluate the performance\nof our detect-then-segment pipeline through: (1) two of the most prevalent segmentation back-\nbones (U-Net and DeepLab_v3); (2) six different image resolutions (512 \u00d7 512, 256 \u00d7 256,\n128 \u00d7 128, 64 \u00d7 64, 32 \u00d7 32, and 28 \u00d7 28); and (3) two different color spaces (RGB and LAB).\nResults: Our detect-then-segment pipeline, with the DeepLab_v3 segmentation framework\noperating on previously detected glomeruli of 512 \u00d7 512 resolution, achieved a 0.953 Dice sim-\nilarity coefficient (DSC), compared with a 0.902 DSC from the end-to-end Mask-RCNN pipe-\nline. Further, we found that neither RGB nor LAB color spaces yield better performance when\ncompared against each other in the context of a detect-then-segment framework.\nConclusions: The detect-then-segment pipeline achieved better segmentation performance com-\npared with the end-to-end method.

Here we applied a method based on measuring chlorophyll A (Chla) content in leaf tissue during the entire autumn senescence processes to appropriately quantify autumn phenological processes. Beginning of leaf coloring could be defined as when about 50% of the Chl was lost. End of leaf coloring could be defined as when about 95% of the Chl was lost. Then the mechanism behind the timing of autumn senescence responses to climate change through hormone regulation was studied for the first time. Four dominate deciduous tree species with representative senescence type (Salix babylonica, Ginkgo biloba, Acer mono, Cotinus coggygria) were chosen as the subject of study. Variations in climate factors (temperature, day length, precipitation, humidity) were recorded and nine major endogenous hormones (IAA, IPA, ZR, DHZR, GA\n\nPropose a novel method combining techniques from at least 2 papers.\n\nFormat your response as:\n<think>\n[Step-by-step reasoning about how methods complement each other]\n</think>\n\nHYPOTHESIS: [Novel combined approach]\nRATIONALE: [Why combining is beneficial]\nMETHODS: [Technical details of integration]\nEXPECTED OUTCOME: [Performance improvements expected]\n\nIMPORTANT: Cite papers as [Author Year, PMID:XXXXX].

Nevertheless, most existing studies on the neural correlates of psychopathology employ case-control designs that treat diagnoses as independent categories, ignoring the highly correlated nature of psychopathology. Thus, for instance, although perturbations in white matter microstructure have been identified across a range of mental disorders, nearly all such studies used case-control designs, leaving it unclear whether observed relations reflect disorder-specific characteristics or transdiagnostic associations. Using a representative sample of 410 young adult twins oversampled for psychopathology risk, we tested the hypothesis that some previously observed relations between white matter microstructure properties in major tracts and specific disorders are related to second-order factors of psychopathology. We examined fractional anisotropy (FA), radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity (AD). White matter correlates of all second-order factors were identified after controlling for multiple statistical tests, including the general factor (FA in the body of the corpus callosum), specific internalizing (AD in the fornix), and specific externalizing (AD in the splenium of the corpus callosum, sagittal stratum, anterior corona radiata, and internal capsule). These findings suggest that some features of white matter within specific tracts may be transdiagnostically associated multiple forms of psychopathology through second-order factors of psychopathology rather with than individual mental disorders.\n\n---\n\n[Bennett Landman 2023, PMID:37213219]\nTitle: White matter microstructural metrics are sensitively associated with clinical staging in Alzheimer's\nAbstract: INTRODUCTION: White matter microstructure may be abnormal along the Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum.

However, clinically routine modalities such as imaging and diagnostic codes can be asynchronous and irregularly sampled over different time scales which are obstacles to longitudinal multimodal learning. In this work, we propose a transformer-based multimodal strategy to integrate repeat imaging with longitudinal clinical signatures from routinely collected EHRs for SPN classification. We perform unsupervised disentanglement of latent clinical signatures and leverage time-distance scaled self-attention to jointly learn from clinical signatures expressions and chest computed tomography (CT) scans. Our classifier is pretrained on 2,668 scans from a public dataset and 1,149 subjects with longitudinal chest CTs, billing codes, medications, and laboratory tests from EHRs of our home institution. Evaluation on 227 subjects with challenging SPNs revealed a significant AUC improvement over a longitudinal multimodal baseline (0.824 vs 0.752 AUC), as well as improvements over a single cross-section multimodal scenario (0.809 AUC) and a longitudinal imaging-only scenario (0.741 AUC). This work demonstrates significant advantages with a novel approach for co-learning longitudinal imaging and non-imaging phenotypes with transformers.

A major challenge to studying this is the relative paucity of datasets of patients with dementia, with/without HFpEF, and relevant neuroimaging. We sought to demonstrate the feasibility of using modern data mining tools to create and analyze clinical imaging datasets and identify the neuroanatomical signature of HFpEF-associated dementia. We leveraged the bioinformatics tools at Vanderbilt University Medical Center to identify patients with a diagnosis of dementia with and without comorbid HFpEF using the electronic health record. We identified high resolution, clinically-acquired neuroimaging data on 30 dementia patients with HFpEF (age 76.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.12\u00a0years, 61% female) as well as 301 age- and sex-matched patients with dementia but without HFpEF to serve as comparators (age 76.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.52\u00a0years, 60% female). We used automated image processing pipelines to parcellate the brain into 132 structures and quantify their volume. We found six regions with significant atrophy associated with HFpEF: accumbens area, amygdala, posterior insula, anterior orbital gyrus, angular gyrus, and cerebellar white matter. There were no regions with atrophy inversely associated with HFpEF. Patients with dementia and HFpEF have a distinct neuroimaging signature compared to patients with dementia only. Five of the six regions identified in are in the temporo-parietal region of the brain.

This study examined associations between cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of AD pathology, synaptic dysfunction, and neuroaxonal injury with two AD imaging signatures. METHODS: Signatures were calculated using published guidelines. Linear regressions related each biomarker to both signatures, adjusting for demographic factors. Bootstrapped analyses tested if associations were stronger with one signature versus the other. RESULTS: Increased phosphorylated tau (p-tau), total tau, and neurofilament light (P-values <.045) related to smaller signatures (indicating greater atrophy). Diagnosis and sex modified associations between p-tau and neurogranin (P-values<.05) and signatures, such that associations were stronger among participants with mild cognitive impairment and female participants. The strength of associations did not differ between signatures. DISCUSSION: Increased evidence of neurodegeneration, axonopathy, and tau phosphorylation relate to greater AD-related atrophy. Tau phosphorylation and synaptic dysfunction may be more prominent in AD-affected regions in females.\n\n---\n\n[Bennett Landman 2025, PMID:41057117]\nTitle: Sensitivity of quantitative diffusion MRI tractography and microstructure to anisotropic spatial sam\nAbstract: PURPOSE: Diffusion weighted MRI (dMRI) and its models of neural structure provide insight into human brain organization and variations in white matter. A recent study by McMaster, et al. showed that complex graph measures of the connectome, the graphical representation of a tractogram, vary with spatial sampling changes, but biases introduced by anisotropic voxels in the process have not been well characterized. This study uses microstructural measures (fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity) and white matter bundle properties (bundle volume, length, and surface area) to further understand the effect of anisotropic voxels on microstructure and tractography. METHODS: The statistical significance of the selected measures derived from dMRI data were assessed by comparing three white matter bundles at different spatial resolutions with 44 subjects from the Human Connectome Project - Young Adult dataset scan/rescan data using the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test. The original isotropic resolution (1.25\u00a0mm isotropic) was explored with 6 anisotropic resolutions with 0.25\u00a0mm incremental steps in the z dimension. Then, all generated resolutions were upsampled to 1.25\u00a0mm isotropic and 1\u00a0mm isotropic. RESULTS: There were statistically significant differences between at least one microstructural and one bundle measure at every resolution (p\u22640.05, corrected for multiple comparisons). Cohen's d coefficient evaluated the effect size of anisotropic voxels on microstructure and tractography. CONCLUSION: Fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity cannot be recovered with basic up-sampling from low quality data with gold-standard data with the methods selected for this study. However, the bundle measures across our selected regions of interest become more repeatable when voxels are resampled to 1\u00a0mm isotropic.\n\nGenerate a hypothesis that addresses what is NOT covered by any paper but could be addressed by combining their approaches.\n\nFormat your response as:\n<think>\n[Step-by-step reasoning about the gap]\n</think>\n\nHYPOTHESIS: [One sentence]\nRATIONALE: [Why novel and feasible]\nMETHODS: [Specific approach with datasets]\nEXPECTED OUTCOME: [Testable prediction with metrics]\n\nIMPORTANT: Cite papers as [Author Year, PMID:XXXXX].

Here, we examine the role of the chemokine/receptor pair CCL20/c-c motif chemokine receptor 6 (CCR6) in mediating colitis-associated colon carcinogenesis induced by SMAD4 loss. METHODS: In silico analysis of SMAD4, CCL20, and CCR6 messenger RNA expression was performed on published transcriptomic data from human ulcerative colitis (UC), and colon and rectal cancer samples. Immunohistochemistry for CCL20 and CCR6 was performed on human tissue microarrays comprising human UC-associated cancer specimens, Mice with conditional, epithelial-specific Smad4 loss with and without germline deletion of the Ccr6 gene were subjected to colitis and followed for up to 3 months. Tumors were quantified histologically, and immune cell populations were analyzed by flow cytometry and immunostaining. RESULTS: In human UC-associated cancers, loss of epithelial SMAD4 was associated with increased CCL20 expression and CCR6+ cells. SMAD4 loss in mouse colon epithelium led to enlarged gut-associated lymphoid tissues and recruitment of immune cells to the mouse colon epithelium and stroma, particularly T regulatory, T CONCLUSIONS: Regulation of mucosal inflammation is central to SMAD4 tumor suppressor function in the colon. A key downstream node in this regulation is suppression of epithelial CCL20 signaling to CCR6 in immune cells. Loss of SMAD4 in the colon epithelium increases CCL20 expression and chemoattraction of CCR6+ immune cells, contributing to greater susceptibility to colon cancer.\n\nIdentify a SHARED limitation and propose how to address it.\n\nFormat your response as:\n<think>\n[Analysis of each paper's limitations]\n[Identification of shared weakness]\n</think>\n\nSHARED LIMITATION: [What's missing across all papers]\nPROPOSED EXTENSION: [How to fix it]\nMETHODS: [Implementation approach]\nEXPECTED OUTCOME: [How this improves on current work]\n\nIMPORTANT: Cite papers as [Author Year, PMID:XXXXX].

This is a retrospective cohort study. From a database of an ongoing thyroid eye disease research study at our institution, we identified 85 subjects who had both clinical examination and laboratory records supporting the diagnosis of thyroid eye disease and concurrent imaging prior to any medical or surgical intervention. Patients were excluded if imaging quality or type was not amenable to segmentation. The images of 170 orbits were analyzed with the developed automated segmentation tool. The main outcome measure was to cross 25 CT structural metrics for each eye with nine clinical markers using a Kendall rank correlation test to identify significant relationships. The Kendall rank correlation test between automatically calculated CT metrics and clinical data demonstrated numerous correlations. Extraocular rectus muscle metrics, such as the average diameter of the superior, medial, and lateral rectus muscles, showed a strong correlation (p\u2009<\u20090.05) with loss of visual acuity and presence of ocular motility defects. Hertel measurements demonstrated a strong correlation (p\u2009<\u20090.05) with volumetric measurements of the optic nerve and other orbital metrics such as the crowding index and proptosis. Optic neuropathy was strongly correlated (p\u2009<\u20090.05) with an increase in the maximum diameter of the superior muscle.

Although numerous potential analyses have been proposed in quantifying image context, there has been no comprehensive study for low-dose single slice CT longitudinal variability with automated segmentation. We studied a total of 1816 slices from 1469 subjects of Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging (BLSA) abdominal dataset using supervised deep learning-based segmentation and unsupervised clustering method. 300 out of 1469 subjects that have two year gap in their first two scans were pick out to evaluate longitudinal variability with measurements including intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and coefficient of variation (CV) in terms of tissues/organs size and mean intensity. We showed that our segmentation methods are stable in longitudinal settings with Dice ranged from 0.821 to 0.962 for thirteen target abdominal tissues structures. We observed high variability in most organ with ICC<0.5, low variability in the area of muscle, abdominal wall, fat and body mask with average ICC\u22650.8.

The Vanderbilt University Institute for Imaging Science (VUIIS) Center for\nComputational Imaging (CCI) has constructed a large-scale image storage and processing infrastructure that is composed of (1) a large-\nscale image database using the eXtensible Neuroimaging Archive Toolkit (XNAT), (2) a content-aware job scheduling platform using\nthe Distributed Automation for XNAT pipeline automation tool (DAX), and (3) a wide variety of encapsulated image processing\npipelines called Bspiders.^ The VUIIS CCI medical image data storage and processing infrastructure have housed and processed nearly\nhalf-million medical image volumes with Vanderbilt Advanced Computing Center for Research and Education (ACCRE), which is the\nHPC facility at the Vanderbilt University. The initial deployment was natively deployed (i.e., direct installations on a bare-metal server)\nwithin the ACCRE hardware and software environments, which lead to issues of portability and sustainability. First, it could be\nlaborious to deploy the entire VUIIS CCI medical image data storage and processing infrastructure to another HPC center with varying\nhardware infrastructure, library availability, and software permission policies. Second, the spiders were not developed in an isolated\nmanner, which has led to software dependency issues during system upgrades or remote software installation. To address such issues,\nherein, we describe recent innovations using containerization techniques with XNAT/DAX which are used to isolate the VUIIS CCI\nmedical image data storage and processing infrastructure from the underlying hardware and software environments. The newly\npresented XNAT/DAX solution has the following new features: (1) multi-level portability from system level to the application level,\n(2) flexible and dynamic software development and expansion, and (3) scalable spider deployment compatible with HPC clusters and\nlocal workstations.\nKeywords Containerized .

Therefore, standard anatomical atlases are needed for \ninterpreting organ-specific analyses. Among abdominal organs, the pancreas \nexhibits notable variability in volumetric morphology, shape, and appearance, \ncomplicating the generalization of population-wide features. Understanding the \ncommon features of a healthy pancreas is crucial for identifying biomarkers and \ndiagnosing pancreatic diseases.\nAPPROACH: We propose a high-resolution CT atlas framework optimized for the \nhealthy pancreas. We introduce a deep-learning-based preprocessing technique to \nextract abdominal ROIs and leverage a hierarchical registration pipeline to \nalign pancreatic anatomy across populations. Briefly, DEEDS affine and non-rigid \nregistration techniques are employed to transfer patient abdominal volumes to a \nfixed high-resolution atlas template. To generate and evaluate the pancreas \natlas, multi-phase contrast CT scans of 443 subjects (aged 15 to 50 years, with \nno reported history of pancreatic disease) were processed.\nRESULTS: The two-stage DEEDS affine and non-rigid registration outperforms other \nstate-of-the-art tools, achieving the highest scores for pancreas label transfer \nacross all phases (non-contrast: 0.497, arterial: 0.505, portal venous: 0.494, \ndelayed: 0.497). External evaluation with 100 portal venous scans and 13 labeled \nabdominal organs shows a mean Dice score of 0.504. The low variance between the \npancreases of registered subjects and the obtained pancreas atlas further \nillustrates the generalizability of the proposed method.\nCONCLUSION: We introduce a high-resolution pancreas atlas framework to \ngeneralize healthy biomarkers across populations with multi-contrast abdominal \nCT.

Perioperative \nstratification of these patients remains a significant challenge. In the present \nstudy, we sought to use machine learning (ML) approaches in conjunction with \nclinical and inflammatory biomarker data to identify patients presenting for \nrevision surgery as a proxy for recalcitrant disease and better understand which \ndata types may be useful in classifying patients.\nMETHODS: Six hundred thirty-four CRS patients were included. All features were \ncategorized into 5 sets: histopathologic markers, cytokine and chemokine \nmarkers, demographic factors, comorbidities, and medication history. \nLeave-one-out cross-validation was employed to train random forest (RF) \nclassifiers separately according to each feature group.\nRESULTS: There were 298 patients with CRS without nasal polyps (CRSsNP) and 336 \npatients with CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). The training results of the RF \nmodel revealed that for CRSsNP patients, the combination of cytokine and \nchemokine markers possessed the highest predictive accuracy, while the \nclassification accuracies of other feature groups were relatively lower. For \nCRSwNP patients, the combination of cytokine and chemokine markers along with \neosinophil and neutrophil-related markers provided the highest classification \nperformance. Considering all patients, the classification model obtained by \njointly training multiple feature combinations demonstrated commendable \nperformance.\nCONCLUSION: Integrating multiple clinical and inflammatory feature sets \nsignificantly enhances the predictive modeling of surgical history in CRS \npatients. These findings highlight the importance of multimodal data integration \nfor improving classification performance and provide valuable insights for \ndeveloping more accurate and clinically applicable ML models in CRS.

Recently, the AJCC has developed a novel, systematic approach incorporating survival data to refine stage groupings. The objective of this study was to demonstrate data-driven optimization of the version 9 AJCC staging system for anal cancer assessed through a defined validation approach. METHODS: The National Cancer Database was queried for patients diagnosed with anal cancer in 2012 through 2017. Kaplan-Meier methods analyzed 5-year survival by individual clinical T category, N category, M category, and overall stage. Cox proportional hazards models validated overall survival of the revised TNM stage groupings. RESULTS: Overall, 24,328 cases of anal cancer were included. Evaluation of the 8th edition AJCC stage groups demonstrated a lack of hierarchical prognostic order. Survival at 5 years for stage I was 84.4%, 77.4% for stage IIA, and 63.7% for stage IIB; however, stage IIIA disease demonstrated a 73.0% survival, followed by 58.4% for stage IIIB, 59.9% for stage IIIC, and 22.5% for stage IV (p <.001). Thus, stage IIB was redefined as T1-2N1M0, whereas Stage IIIA was redefined as T3N0-1M0. Reevaluation of 5-year survival based on data-informed stage groupings now demonstrates hierarchical prognostic order and validated via Cox proportional hazards models. CONCLUSION: The 8th edition AJCC survival data demonstrated a lack of hierarchical prognostic order and informed revised stage groupings in the version 9 AJCC staging system for anal cancer. Thus, a validated data-driven optimization approach can be implemented for staging revisions across all disease sites moving forward.\n\n---\n\n[Hirak Sarkar 2024, PMID:38940134]\nTitle: A count-based model for delineating cell-cell interactions in spatial transcriptomics data.\nFull Text (excerpt): # Paper 38940134\n\n**Professor:** Sarkar\n**PMID:** 38940134\n\n## Full Text\n\nBioinformatics, 2024, 40, i481\u2013i489\nhttps://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btae219\nISMB 2024\nA count-based model for delineating cell\u2013cell interactions\nin spatial transcriptomics data\n1,\ufffd\nHirak Sarkar1,2,\u2021, Uthsav Chitra1,\u2021, Julian Gold1,3, Benjamin J.

Since direct measure\u00ad\nment of CCIs is challenging, multiple methods have been developed to infer CCIs by quantifying correlations between the gene expression of\nthe ligands and receptors that mediate CCIs, originally from bulk RNA-sequencing data and more recently from single-cell or spatially resolved\ntranscriptomics (SRT) data. SRT has a particular advantage over single-cell approaches, since ligand\u2013receptor correlations can be computed be\u00ad\ntween cells or spots that are physically close in the tissue. However, the transcript counts of individual ligands and receptors in SRT data are\ngenerally low, complicating the inference of CCIs from expression correlations.\nResults: We introduce Copulacci, a count-based model for inferring CCIs from SRT data. Copulacci uses a Gaussian copula to model dependen\u00ad\ncies between the expression of ligands and receptors from nearby spatial locations even when the transcript counts are low. On simulated\ndata, Copulacci outperforms existing CCI inference methods based on the standard Spearman and Pearson correlation coefficients. Using sev\u00ad\neral real SRT datasets, we show that Copulacci discovers biologically meaningful ligand\u2013receptor interactions that are lowly expressed and\nundiscoverable by existing CCI inference methods.\nAvailability and implementation: Copulacci is implemented in Python and available at https://github.com/raphael-group/copulacci.\n1 Introduction                                                                    curated database (T\u20ac  urei et al. 2021, Efremova et al. 2020, Jin\net al. 2021) of validated or predicted CCIs.\nCell\u2013cell interactions (CCIs) are fundamental to many biolog\u00ad\nAn important limitation of using scRNA-seq data to infer\nical processes in multicellular organisms including cellular\nCCIs is that scRNA-seq technologies dissociate cells before\ndifferentiation (Amprino 1953, Kirouac et al. 2010), homeo\u00ad\nsta\n\nPropose a novel method combining techniques from at least 2 papers.\n\nFormat your response as:\n<think>\n[Step-by-step reasoning about how methods complement each other]\n</think>\n\nHYPOTHESIS: [Novel combined approach]\nRATIONALE: [Why combining is beneficial]\nMETHODS: [Technical details of integration]\nEXPECTED OUTCOME: [Performance improvements expected]\n\nIMPORTANT: Cite papers as [Author Year, PMID:XXXXX].

Reading is supported by network of interconnected \nleft hemisphere brain regions, including temporo-parietal, occipito-temporal, \nand inferior-frontal circuits. Poor readers often show hypoactivation and \nreduced gray matter volumes in this reading network, with hyperactivation and \nincreased volumes in the posterior right hemisphere. We assessed gray matter \ndevelopment longitudinally in pre-reading children aged 2-5 years using magnetic \nresonance imaging (MRI) (N\u00a0=\u00a032, 110 MRI scans; mean age: 4.40 \u00b1 0.77 years), \nhalf of whom had a family history of reading disorder. The family history group \nshowed slower proportional growth (relative to total brain volume) in the left \nsupramarginal and inferior frontal gyri, and faster proportional growth in the \nright angular, right fusiform, and bilateral lingual gyri. This suggests delayed \ndevelopment of left hemisphere reading areas in children with a family history \nof dyslexia, along with faster growth in right homologues. This alternate \ndevelopment pattern may predispose the brain to later reading difficulties and \nmay later manifest as the commonly noted compensatory mechanisms. The results of \nthis study further shows our understanding of structural brain alterations that \nmay form the neurological basis of reading difficulties.\n\n\u00a9 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.\n\nDOI: 10.1111/desc.13160\nPMID: 34278658 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n---\n\n[Yuankai Huo 2021, PMID:33560981]\nTitle: Body Part Regression With Self-Supervision.\nFull Text (excerpt): # Paper 33560981\n\n**Professor:** Huo\n**PMID:** 33560981\n\n## Full Text\n\nHHS Public Access\nAuthor manuscript\nIEEE Trans Med Imaging.

This study examines the cross-sectional association between gray matter mean\ndiffusivity (MD) and LTV in community-dwelling older adults.\nMethods\u2014Study participants consisted of 449 high-functioning adults aged 50 and older (56.8%\nfemale) in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, free of overt neurological disease. The\nAuthor Manuscript\nmagnitude of MD in the gray matter, a measure of impaired tissue integrity, was assessed by\ndiffusion tensor imaging in 16 regions of interest (ROIs) involved with executive function,\nsensorimotor function, and memory. LTV was assessed as variability in lap time based on\nindividual trajectories over ten 40-m laps. Age, sex, height, and weight were covariates. The\nmodel additionally adjusted for mean lap time and health conditions that may affect LTV.\nResults\u2014Higher levels of average MD across 16 ROIs were significantly associated with higher\nLTV after adjustment for covariates. Specifically, higher MD in the precuneus and the anterior\nand middle cingulate cortices was strongly associated with higher LTV, as compared to other\nROIs. The association persisted after adjustment for mean lap time, hypertension, and diabetes.\nConclusions\u2014Lower gray matter integrity in selected areas may underlie greater LTV in high-\nfunctioning community-dwelling older adults. Longitudinal studies are warranted to examine\nAuthor Manuscript\nwhether changes in gray matter integrity precede more variable gait.\n*\nCorresponding author: 251 Bayview Blvd., Suite 100, Rm 04B316, Baltimore, Maryland 21224, Phone: 410-558-8232, Fax:\n410-558-8674, qu.tian@nih.gov.\nConflict of interest\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest\nPublisher's Disclaimer: This is a PDF file of an unedited manuscript that has been accepted for publication.

One third of patients with advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) present with bone\nmetastasis at the time of diagnosis. However, the bone metastatic niche in humans, including the immune and stro\u2011\nmal microenvironments, has not been well-defined, hindering progress towards identification of therapeutic targets.\nMethods We collected fresh patient samples and performed single-cell transcriptomic profiling of solid meta\u2011\nstatic tissue (Bone Met), liquid bone marrow at the vertebral level of spinal cord compression (Involved), and liquid\nbone marrow from a different vertebral body distant from the tumor site but within the surgical field (Distal), as well\nas bone marrow from patients undergoing hip replacement surgery (Benign). In addition, we incorporated single-cell\ndata from primary ccRCC tumors (ccRCC Primary) for comparative analysis.\nResults The bone marrow of metastatic patients is immune-suppressive, featuring increased, exhausted CD8 + cyto\u2011\ntoxic T cells, T regulatory cells, and tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) with distinct transcriptional states in meta\u2011\nstatic lesions. Bone marrow stroma from tumor samples demonstrated a tumor-associated mesenchymal stromal cell\npopulation (TA-MSC) that appears to be supportive of epithelial-to mesenchymal transition (EMT), bone remodeling,\nand a cancer-associated fibroblast (CAFs) phenotype.

Studies that combine samples from various sites may be introducing confounding due to site-specific artifacts and patterns. Differences in bias and variance across sites may render the scans incomparable, and, without correction, any inferences obtained from these data are misleading. We present an analysis of the bias and variance of scans of the same subjects across different sites and evaluate their impact on statistical analyses. In previous work, we presented a simulation extrapolation (SIMEX) technique for bias estimation as well as a wild bootstrap technique for variance estimation in metrics obtained from a Q-ball imaging (QBI) reconstruction of empirical high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) data. We now apply those techniques to data acquired from 5 healthy volunteers on 3 independent scanners under closely matched acquisition protocols. The bias and variance of GFA measurements were estimated on a voxel-wise basis for each scan and compared across study sites to identify site-specific differences. Further, we provide model recommendations that can be used to determine the extent of the impact of bias and variance as well as aspects of the analysis to account for these differences. We include a decision tree to help researchers determine if model adjustments are necessary based on the bias and variance results.\n\nIdentify a SHARED limitation and propose how to address it.\n\nFormat your response as:\n<think>\n[Analysis of each paper's limitations]\n[Identification of shared weakness]\n</think>\n\nSHARED LIMITATION: [What's missing across all papers]\nPROPOSED EXTENSION: [How to fix it]\nMETHODS: [Implementation approach]\nEXPECTED OUTCOME: [How this improves on current work]\n\nIMPORTANT: Cite papers as [Author Year, PMID:XXXXX].

Manual tracing has been regarded as the gold\nstandard method of body segmentation; however, manual tracing is time-consuming. Many semi-\nautomated/automated algorithms have been proposed to avoid the manual efforts. Previous efforts\nlargely focused on segmenting 2D cross-sectional images (e.g., at L3/T4 vertebra locations) rather\nthan on the whole-body volume. In this paper, we propose a fully automated 3D body composition\nAuthor Manuscript\nestimation framework for segmenting the muscle and fat from abdominal CT scans. The 3D whole\nbody segmentations were reconstructed from a slice-wise multi-atlas label fusion (MALF) based\nframework. First, we used a low-dimensional atlas representation to estimate each class for each\naxial slice. Second, the abdominal wall and psoas muscle were segmented by combining MALF\nwith active shape models and deformable models. Third, skeletal muscle, visceral adipose tissue\n(VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) were measured to assess the areas of muscle and fat\ntissue. The proposed method was compared to manual segmentation and demonstrated high\naccuracy. Then, we evaluated the approach on 40 CT scans comparing the new method to a prior\natlas-based segmentation method and achieved 0.854, 0.740, 0.887 and 0.933 on Dice similarity\nindex for the skeletal muscle, psoas muscle, VAT and SAT, respectively. Compared with the\nbaseline, our method showed significantly (p < 0.001) higher accuracy on skeletal muscle, VAT\nand SAT estimation.\nAuthor Manuscript\nKeywords\nSkeletal Muscle; Psoas Muscle; Visceral Fat; Subcutaneous Fat; Multi-atlas\nHu et al.

However, it requires non-trivial efforts to implement these methods on different models. We present LlamaFactory, a unified framework that integrates a suite of cutting-edge efficient training methods. It provides a solution for flexibly customizing the fine-tuning of 100+ LLMs without the need for coding through the built-in web UI LlamaBoard. We empirically validate the efficiency and effectiveness of our framework on language modeling and text generation tasks.

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has the potential to investigate both genetic and nongenetic sources of tumor heterogeneity in a single assay. Here we present a computational method, Numbat, that integrates haplotype information obtained from population-based phasing with allele and expression signals to enhance detection of copy number variations from scRNA-seq. Numbat exploits the evolutionary relationships between subclones to iteratively infer single-cell copy number profiles and tumor clonal phylogeny. Analysis of 22\u2009tumor samples, including multiple myeloma, gastric, breast and thyroid cancers, shows that Numbat can reconstruct the tumor copy number profile and precisely identify malignant cells in the tumor microenvironment. We identify genetic subpopulations with transcriptional signatures relevant to tumor progression and therapy resistance. Numbat requires neither sample-matched DNA data nor a priori genotyping, and is applicable to a wide range of experimental settings and cancer types.\n\nIdentify a SHARED limitation and propose how to address it.\n\nFormat your response as:\n<think>\n[Analysis of each paper's limitations]\n[Identification of shared weakness]\n</think>\n\nSHARED LIMITATION: [What's missing across all papers]\nPROPOSED EXTENSION: [How to fix it]\nMETHODS: [Implementation approach]\nEXPECTED OUTCOME: [How this improves on current work]\n\nIMPORTANT: Cite papers as [Author Year, PMID:XXXXX].

The network is specifically tailored for our intraglomerular tissue and lesion segmentation tasks. As illustrated in Fig.\u00a03, given a patch image, the backbone employs downsampling blocks to progressively extract high-level semantic features, and upsampling blocks to gradually restore spatial resolution. On top of this backbone, the architecture integrates a class-aware controller that fuses class-specific knowledge with image features, followed by a dynamic head for task-specific segmentation.\n\nThis figure illustrates the proposed network architecture, which comprises a residual U-Net backbone, a class-aware controller, and a single dynamic segmentation head. A class-aware knowledge encoder is integrated into the framework for multi-label segmentation, and a feature-based fusion block is employed to aggregate the features into the final dynamic head parameters.\n\nUnlike fully labeled datasets, each image included in a partially labeled dataset contains the annotations of only a specific class involved. To enable task awareness, we treat each segmentation of a specific tissue or lesion class as a distinct task, encoding it using an m-dimensional one-hot vector.31 The m is the number of classes. The encoding calculation for Tk, a class-aware vector of the i\u2019th class of lesion is shown as follows: Tk={1,if\u2009\u2009k=i0,otherwise,k=1,2,\u2026,m.(1)\n\nDynamic filter generation32 was introduced to generate the kernels specialized to a particular class of segment tasks. A class-aware controller is used to aggregate the image feature F by combining a global average pooling with Tk. The kernel parameters \u03c9 are computed as follows: \u03c9=\u03d5(GAP(F)\u2225Tk;\u0398\u03d5),(2)where \u0398\u03d5 represents the controller parameters, \u201c\u2225\u201d represents the concatenation operation to combine high-level image features and the class-aware vector, and \u03d5 reprensents a task-specific controller with a single two-dimensional convolutional layer.\n\nThe dynamic head was designed to achieve multi-label segmentation with three layers, denoted by \u03c91, \u03c92, and \u03c93. The predictions of lesions can be generated as follows: P=M*\u03c91*\u03c92*\u03c93 where * is the convolution, and M is the output from the decoder.\n\nTo obtain a large-scale dataset of unannotated glomerular images, we leverage our previous work, Glo-In-One, which enabled the collection of over 30,000 such images through extensive web-based image mining. This process involved the separation of compound figures retrieved via the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Open-i\u00ae search engine. Further details of the compound figure collection and image mining methodology can be found in Ref.\u00a033.\n\nTo facilitate glomerular quantification for non-technical users, we developed the Glo-In-Onev2 toolkit; as shown in Fig.\u00a04, an all-in-one solution that enables comprehensive glomerul\n\n---\n\n[Yuankai Huo 2019, PMID:31247249]\nTitle: Anatomical context improves deep learning on the brain age estimation task.\nFull Text (excerpt): # Paper 31247249\n\n**Professor:** Huo\n**PMID:** 31247249\n\n## Full Text\n\nHHS Public Access\nAuthor manuscript\nMagn Reson Imaging.

In this work, we hypothesize that deep learning is complementary to\ntraditional feature estimation. We propose a network design to include traditional structural\nimaging features alongside deep convolutional ones and illustrate this approach on the task of\nimaging-based age prediction in two separate contexts: Tl-weighted brain magnetic resonance\nimaging (MRI) (N = 5,121, ages 4-96, healthy controls) and computed tomography (CT) of the\nhead (N = 1,313, ages 1 \u2013 97, healthy controls). In brain MRI, we can predict age with a mean\nabsolute error of 4.08 years by combining raw images along with engineered structural features,\ncompared to 5.00 years using image-derived features alone and 8.23 years using structural features\nalone. In head CT, we can predict age with a median absolute error of 9.99 years combining\nfeatures, compared to 11.02 years with image-derived features alone and 13.28 years with\nstructural features alone. These results show that we can complement traditional feature estimation\nAuthor Manuscript\nusing deep learning to improve prediction tasks. As the field of medical image processing\ncontinues to integrate deep learning, it will be important to use the new techniques to complement\ntraditional imaging features instead of fully displacing them.\nCorresponding Author: Name: Camilo Bermudez, Address: 2301 Vanderbilt Pl., PO Box 351679 Station B, Nashville, TN\n37235-1679, Phone Number: (615)322-2338, camilo.bermudez@vanderbilt.edu.\nPublisher's Disclaimer: This is a PDF file of an unedited manuscript that has been accepted for publication.

Previous studies have largely focused cross-sectional (single)\nCT data. Herein, we consider longitudinal data. The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model\naddresses learning with regularly spaced time points (i.e., equal temporal intervals). However,\nclinical imaging follows patient needs with often heterogeneous, irregular acquisitions. To model\nboth regular and irregular longitudinal samples, we generalize the LSTM model with the\nDistanced LSTM (DLSTM) for temporally varied acquisitions. The DLSTM includes a Temporal\nEmphasis Model (TEM) that enables learning across regularly and irregularly sampled intervals.\nBriefly, (1) the temporal intervals between longitudinal scans are modeled explicitly, (2)\nAuthor Manuscript\ntemporally adjustable forget and input gates are introduced for irregular temporal sampling; and\n(3) the latest longitudinal scan has an additional emphasis term. We evaluate the DLSTM\nframework in three datasets including simulated data, 1794 National Lung Screening Trial (NLST)\nscans, and 1420 clinically acquired data with heterogeneous and irregular temporal accession. The\nexperiments on the first two datasets demonstrate that our method achieves competitive\nperformance on both simulated and regularly sampled datasets (e.g. improve LSTM from 0.6785\nto 0.7085 on F1 score in NLST). In external validation of clinically and irregularly acquired data,\nthe benchmarks achieved 0.8350 (CNN feature) and 0.8380 (LSTM) on area under the ROC curve\n(AUC) score, while the proposed DLSTM achieves 0.8905.\nKeywords\nAuthor Manuscript\nLung cancer; Longitudinal; LSTM; Time distance; TEM\n1    Introduction\nEarly detection of lung cancer from clinically acquired computed tomography (CT) scans\nare essential for lung cancer diagnosis [1].

In addition, we proposed a local cache system to reduce interaction times with REDCap for large-scale data records. Experimental setups include assessing barcode recognition accuracy under various levels of image blurring, showcasing different study types managed with the organ-specific archive, and measuring system throughput and response times with and without the proposed local cache system.\n\nIn this section, we detail the development and evaluation processes designed to meet the 3 proposed design criteria: improving barcode robustness, incorporating a dynamic organ-specific archive, and optimizing system throughput. Each methodology and experimental setup ensures the solutions are effective and practical for real-life clinical settings.\n\nThe data management workflow for 2 Python-based applications from [20], the Printer app and the Data entry app, which are integral components of our biopsy management with REDCap, is presented in Figure 2(A-B).\n\nBriefly, the Printer app workflow begins by entering the patient ID, which autofills the patient group based on control or study or disease-related subgroups. Next, the clinician ID is selected, and a print option is chosen, ranging from default to including extra frozen biopsies. The \u201cBarcode Printing\u201d step, highlighted in a green box in Figure 2, was identified as a bottleneck due to limitations in printer quality and previously selected barcode design. Finally, print events are synced to REDCap, ensuring all printed barcodes are recorded in the system.\n\nThe data entry app workflow starts by scanning the barcode and selecting the clinician ID. If samples are collected, the user enters the sample location information and selects the organ information, both highlighted in yellow boxes in Figure 2. The previous system could only handle one static organ selection, which was a limitation given the diverse clinical studies we manage. If samples are not collected, the barcode is marked as not collected, and the relevant REDCap field is removed. Syncing sample archive information to REDCap, highlighted in a red box in Figure 2, is where the interaction bottleneck was found, which is critical for optimizing system throughput.\n\nNext, we introduce design criteria based on the 3 identified bottlenecks in detail.\n\nTo address the issue of barcode robustness, a series of validations (Figure 3) was conducted to assess various barcode technologies and printing methods for decoding 8-digit numerical data [20] (necessitated by the limitations of printer quality and the tiny barcode size).

Data from the BLSA cohort are available upon request by a proposal submission through the BLSA website (www.blsa.nih.gov). BIOCARD, begun in 1995, includes participants who were middle aged and cognitively intact at baseline.

The\nmodel additionally adjusted for mean lap time and health conditions that may affect LTV.\nResults\u2014Higher levels of average MD across 16 ROIs were significantly associated with higher\nLTV after adjustment for covariates. Specifically, higher MD in the precuneus and the anterior\nand middle cingulate cortices was strongly associated with higher LTV, as compared to other\nROIs.

This study examines the cross-sectional association between gray matter mean\ndiffusivity (MD) and LTV in community-dwelling older adults.\nMethods\u2014Study participants consisted of 449 high-functioning adults aged 50 and older (56.8%\nfemale) in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, free of overt neurological disease. The\nAuthor Manuscript\nmagnitude of MD in the gray matter, a measure of impaired tissue integrity, was assessed by\ndiffusion tensor imaging in 16 regions of interest (ROIs) involved with executive function,\nsensorimotor function, and memory. LTV was assessed as variability in lap time based on\nindividual trajectories over ten 40-m laps. Age, sex, height, and weight were covariates. The\nmodel additionally adjusted for mean lap time and health conditions that may affect LTV.\nResults\u2014Higher levels of average MD across 16 ROIs were significantly associated with higher\nLTV after adjustment for covariates. Specifically, higher MD in the precuneus and the anterior\nand middle cingulate cortices was strongly associated with higher LTV, as compared to other\nROIs. The association persisted after adjustment for mean lap time, hypertension, and diabetes.\nConclusions\u2014Lower gray matter integrity in selected areas may underlie greater LTV in high-\nfunctioning community-dwelling older adults.

Written informed consent was waived by the IRB due to the retrospective nature of the study and the use of residual samples without any clinical data collection. To create the training datasets, we utilized a 4 \u03bcm-thick colon cancer tissue slide prepared as tumor microarrays. The slide was newly diagnosed and reviewed by a pathologist (SJS) at Gangnam Severance Hospital in January 2023. Among 26 cases, a colon cancer tissue slide with grade two was randomly selected. From the chosen case, a formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue block was obtained. The tissue block was sliced to a 4\u2009\u03bcm thickness using a microtome. The slice was carefully placed on a slide glass and deparaffinized using xylene. Subsequently, the slide was then stained with H&E, mounted with a mounting medium (Consul-Mount, Epredia), which has an RI value of 1.495 measured by a refractometer (R-5000, Atago), and finally covered with coverslips. Annotations of glands and stroma in the H&E stained images were carried out by an experienced pathologist (SJS).\n\nFor the label-free thick tissue slides used in the testing phase, we randomly selected two cases of colon cancer. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded blocks from the selected cases were sliced into 10, 20, and 50 \u03bcm-thick sections using a microtome, respectively. The subsequent procedures were consistent with those of training datasets, except that we did not stain the slides and mounted the slides immediately after the deparaffinization.\n\nFor the training datasets, we obtained four gastric cancer tissue slides, each with a 5\u2009\u03bcm thickness and H&E stain. The slide was newly diagnosed and reviewed by pathologists at the Seoul National University Boramae Medical Center in January 2006. The slide preparation procedures were consistent with those conducted at Gangnam Severance Hospital.\n\nFor testing purposes, a label-free, 20 \u03bcm-thick tissue slide was randomly selected from the gastric cancer cases. The slide was prepared using the same procedures as those performed at Gangnam Severance Hospital.\n\nTo measure the RI distributions of tissue slides, we employed a low-coherence holotomography setup (HT-X1 and X1-Plus, Tomocube). This system measures transmitted intensity images of a sample using four optimized K\u00f6hler illumination patterns31, from which the 3D RI distribution was reconstructed by deconvolution of the intensity images with theoretically estimated point spread functions. In the experimental setup, a light-emitting diode (LED) with a center wavelength of 449\u2009nm within a digital micromirror device (DMD) module (DLP4500, Texas Instrument) was used as the illumination source. The blue wavelength was chosen to avoid overlap with the peak absorption spectrum of H&E staining.

Although whole-exome sequencing (WES) has been applied to case series of a few selected prenatal cases, its value in routine clinical settings has not been prospectively assessed in a large unselected cohort of fetuses with structural anomalies. We therefore aimed to determine the incremental diagnostic yield (ie, the added value) of WES following uninformative results of standard investigations with karyotype testing and chromosomal microarray in an unselected cohort of sequential pregnancies showing fetal structural anomalies. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, the parents of fetuses who were found to have a structural anomaly in a prenatal ultrasound were screened for possible participation in the study. These participants were predominantly identified in or were referred to the Columbia University Carmen and John Thain Center for Prenatal Pediatrics (New York, NY, USA). Fetuses with confirmed aneuploidy or a causal pathogenic copy number variant were excluded from WES analyses. By use of WES of the fetuses and parents (parent-fetus trios), we identified genetic variants that indicated an underlying cause (diagnostic genetic variants) and genetic variants that met the criteria of bioinformatic signatures that had previously been described to be significantly enriched among diagnostic genetic variants. FINDINGS: Between April 24, 2015, and April 19, 2017, 517 sequentially identified pregnant women found to have fetuses with a structural anomaly were screened for their eligibility for inclusion in our study. 71 (14%) couples declined testing, 87 (17%) trios were missing at least one DNA sample (from either parent or the fetus), 69 (13%) trios had a clinically relevant abnormal karyotype or chromosomal microarray finding, 51 (10%) couples did not consent to WES or withdrew consent, and five (1%) samples were not of good enough quality for analysis. DNA samples from 234 (45%) eligible trios were therefore used for analysis of the primary outcome. By use of trio sequence data, we identified diagnostic genetic variants in 24 (10%) families. Mutations with bioinformatic signatures that were indicative of pathogenicity but with insufficient evidence to be considered diagnostic were also evaluated; 46 (20%) of the 234 fetuses assessed were found to have such signatures. INTERPRETATION: Our analysis of WES data in a prospective cohort of unselected fetuses with structural anomalies shows the value added by WES following the use of routine genetic tests. Our findings suggest that, in cases of fetal anomalies in which assessment with karyotype testing and chromosomal microarray fail to determine the underlying cause of a structural anomaly, WES can add clinically relevant information that could assist current management of a pregnancy.

The proposed Hadoop system was\nimplemented on a production lab-cluster alongside a standard Sun Grid Engine (SGE). Theoretical\nmodels for wall-clock time and resource time for both approaches are introduced and validated. To\nprovide real example data, three T1 image archives were retrieved from a university secure, shared\nweb database and used to empirically assess computational performance under three\nconfigurations of cluster hardware (using 72, 109, or 209 CPU cores) with differing job lengths.\nEmpirical results match the theoretical models.

Simulation and phantom-based studies suggest that QBI results are affected by the b-value, the number of diffusion weighting directions, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). However, optimal acquisition schemes for QBI in clinical settings are largely undetermined given empirical (observed) imaging considerations. In this study, we acquire a HARDI dataset at five b-values with 11 repetitions on a single subject to investigate the effects of acquisition scheme and subsequent analysis models on the accuracy and precision of measures of tissue composition and fiber orientation derived from clinically feasible QBI at 3T. Clinical feasibility entails short scan protocols - less than 5minutes in the current study - resulting in lower SNR, lower b-values, and fewer diffusion directions than are typical in most QBI protocols with research applications, where time constraints are less prevalent. In agreement with previous studies, we find that the b-value and number of diffusion directions impact the magnitude and variation of QBI indices in both white matter and gray matter regions; however, QBI indices are most heavily dependent on the maximum order of the spherical harmonic (SH) series used to represent the diffusion orientation distribution function (ODF). Specifically, to ensure numerical stability and reduce the occurrence of false peaks and inflated anisotropy, we recommend oversampling by at least 8-12 more diffusion directions than the number of estimated coefficients for a given SH order. In addition, in an equal scan time comparison of QBI accuracy, we find that increasing the directional resolution of the HARDI dataset is preferable to repeating observations; however, our results indicate that as few as 32 directions at a low b-value (1000s/mm\n\n---\n\n[Mary Kay Washington 2024, PMID:39427081]\nTitle: The reverse transsulfuration pathway affects the colonic microbiota and contributes to colitis in mice.\nAbstract: Cystathionine \u03b3-lyase (CTH) is a critical enzyme in the reverse transsulfuration pathway, the major route for the metabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids, notably converting cystathionine to cysteine.

We train our model using 100 scans each from seven representative kernels (Siemens B50f, Siemens B30f, GE BONE, GE STANDARD, GE LUNG, Philips C, and Philips D) from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) dataset, enabling harmonization across 42 different kernel combinations. Using 240 withheld scans from each kernel, we evaluate our approach on paired kernels using percent emphysema. For unpaired kernels, we harmonize all scans to the style of a reference soft kernel (Siemens B30f) and evaluate our model using percent emphysema, followed by a general linear model analysis that investigates the impact of age, sex, smoking status, and kernel on emphysema. Additionally, we harmonize all soft kernels to a reference hard kernel (Siemens B50f), quantifying percent emphysema. We assess anatomical consistency in unpaired kernels harmonized to a reference soft kernel by comparing segmentations of lung vessels, muscle, and subcutaneous adipose tissue derived from TotalSegmentator between the non\u2010harmonized and harmonized images. We compare the performance of our model to the standard cycleGAN and a switchable cycleGAN model.\n\nInspired by prior research on paired and unpaired kernel harmonization, we leverage the cycleGAN model to develop a multipath cycleGAN model that harmonizes paired and unpaired kernels in a low dose lung cancer screening population from multiple vendors through a shared latent space trained in two stages. In our previous work,\n31\n we developed a multipath cycleGAN model to address paired and unpaired CT kernel harmonization for images reconstructed from Siemens and GE scanners. This approach introduced a shared latent space that allowed for harmonization across different combinations of reconstruction kernels using domain specific encoder\u2010decoder architectures and discriminators.\n\nWe expand upon our previous work by proposing a two\u2010stage multipath cycleGAN model that involves a larger dataset from various kernels and standardized field of view across all images. In Stage one, we harmonize across all possible combinations of reconstruction kernels obtained from the Siemens and GE vendors. We incorporate an additional loss function between the input source kernel and output target kernel for a given path to ensure that the radio\u2010opacity of the images do not shift during harmonization. In Stage two, we freeze the encoders and decoders trained in Stage one and train all discriminators and the networks for the Stage two kernels to facilitate harmonization across all combinations of kernels from the Philips and GE vendors.

The mice were housed in standard cages at a maximum of eight per cage in a temperature- and humidity-controlled room with 12-hour light/12-hour dark cycles and given sterile water and food ad libitum. To monitor tumor development, all mice underwent genotyping on ear tissue biopsies (Transnetyx, Inc.) using qPCR with specific probes for the MYCN transgene or wild-type gene and abdominal palpations, as previously described in Rasmuson and colleagues (30). Both male and female TH-MYCN transgenic mice were included in this study, comprising six homozygous mice (ages 37\u201343 days) and six hemizygous mice (ages 54\u201397 days; see Supplementary Table S1). The mice were closely observed upon tumor development for signs of discomfort and euthanized using carbon dioxide. At sacrifice, the tumors were dissected into smaller pieces and either enzymatically dissociated or fixed in formaldehyde for further experiments.\n\nIn vivo experiments were reviewed and approved by the regional ethics committee for animal research: the Stockholm regional ethics committee (ethical permits ID: 5163-2019 and 4356-2024), appointed and under the control of the Swedish Board of Agriculture and Swedish Court. National and European Union (EU) regulations (SFS 2018:1192, SFS 2019:66, and SFS 2007:488 and EU directive 2010/63/EU) were followed, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering.\n\nFor dissociation, fresh tumor samples from the TH-MYCN mice were collected in cold Medium 199 (Life Technologies, cat. #12350-039) supplemented with 2% FBS. The tumors were cut into smaller pieces (1 mm3). To obtain single-cell suspensions, the small tumor pieces were enzymatically dissociated in Dissociation Medium: 1 mg/mL of collagenases I to IV (Worthington Biochemical), 2 mg/mL of dispase (Gibco, cat. #17105-041) dissolved in Medium 199 for sorting or, Advanced DMEM/F-12 (Gibco, 12634010) for culturing, supplemented with 2% FBS, DNase I Solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. #90083; 1:100), and RNaseOUT (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. #10777019; 1:1,000), for 45 minutes at 37\u00b0C with shaking at 120 rpm. The dissociation reactions were subsequently quenched in sorting medium (Media 199 supplemented with 2% FBS), filtered using a 70-micron filter, and then centrifuged at 500 g for 5 minutes at 4\u00b0C.

Little is known about how basal ganglia ePVS interact with apolipoprotein (APOE)-\u03b54 status. Vanderbilt Memory and Aging Project participants (n\u00a0=\u00a0326, 73\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07, 59% male) underwent 3\u00a0T brain MRI at baseline to assess ePVS and longitudinal neuropsychological assessments. The interaction between ePVS volume and APOE-\u03b54 carrier status was related to baseline outcomes using ordinary least squares regressions and longitudinal cognition using linear mixed-effects regressions. ePVS volume interacted with APOE-\u03b54 status on cross-sectional naming performance (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.002, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002), and executive function excluding outliers (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.001, p\u00a0=\u00a00.009). There were no significant longitudinal interactions (p-values>0.10) except for Coding excluding outliers (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.002, p\u00a0=\u00a00.05). While cross-sectional models stratified by APOE-\u03b54 status indicated greater ePVS related to worse cognition mostly in APOE-\u03b54 carriers, longitudinal models stratified by APOE-\u03b54 status showed greater ePVS volume related to worse cognition among APOE-\u03b54 non-carriers only. Results indicated that greater ePVS volume interacts with APOE-\u03b54 status on cognition cross-sectionally. Longitudinally, the association of greater ePVS volume and worse cognition appears stronger in APOE-\u03b54 non-carriers, possibly due to the deleterious effects of APOE-\u03b54 on cognition across the lifespan.\n\n---\n\n[Bennett Landman 2023, PMID:37455933]\nTitle: Changes in white matter functional networks across late adulthood.\nAbstract: INTRODUCTION: The aging brain is characterized by decreases in not only neuronal density but also reductions in myelinated white matter (WM) fibers that provide the essential foundation for communication between cortical regions. Age-related degeneration of WM has been previously characterized by histopathology as well as T2 FLAIR and diffusion MRI. Recent studies have consistently shown that BOLD (blood oxygenation level dependent) effects in WM are robustly detectable, are modulated by neural activities, and thus represent a complementary window into the functional organization of the brain. However, there have been no previous systematic studies of whether or how WM BOLD signals vary with normal aging. We therefore performed a comprehensive quantification of WM BOLD signals across scales to evaluate their potential as indicators of functional changes that arise with aging. METHODS: By using spatial independent component analysis (ICA) of BOLD signals acquired in a resting state, WM voxels were grouped into spatially distinct functional units. The functional connectivities (FCs) within and among those units were measured and their relationships with aging were assessed. On a larger spatial scale, a graph was reconstructed based on the pair-wise connectivities among units, modeling the WM as a complex network and producing a set of graph-theoretical metrics. RESULTS: The spectral powers that reflect the intensities of BOLD signals were found to be significantly affected by aging across more than half of the WM units. The functional connectivities (FCs) within and among those units were found to decrease significantly with aging. We observed a widespread reduction of graph-theoretical metrics, suggesting a decrease in the ability to exchange information between remote WM regions with aging. DISCUSSION: Our findings converge to support the notion that WM BOLD signals in specific regions, and their interactions with other regions, have the potential to serve as imaging markers of aging.\n\n---\n\n[Bennett Landman 2019, PMID:30602428]\nTitle: Electronic Medical Record Context Signatures Improve Diagnostic Classification Using Medical Image C\nAbstract: Composite models that combine medical imaging with electronic medical records (EMR) improve predictive power when compared to traditional models that use imaging alone. The digitization of EMR provides potential access to a wealth of medical information, but presents new challenges in algorithm design and inference. Previous studies, such as Phenome Wide Association Study (PheWAS), have shown that EMR data can be used to investigate the relationship between genotypes and clinical conditions. Here, we introduce Phenome-Disease Association Study to extend the statistical capabilities of the PheWAS software through a custom Python package, which creates diagnostic EMR signatures to capture system-wide co-morbidities for a disease population within a given time interval. We investigate the effect of integrating these EMR signatures with radiological data to improve diagnostic classification in disease domains known to have confounding factors because of variable and complex clinical presentation. Specifically, we focus on two studies: First, a study of four major optic nerve related conditions; and second, a study of diabetes. Addition of EMR signature vectors to radiologically derived structural metrics improves the area under the curve (AUC) for diagnostic classification using elastic net regression, for diseases of the optic nerve. For glaucoma, the AUC improves from 0.71 to 0.83, for intrinsic optic nerve disease it increases from 0.72 to 0.91, for optic nerve edema it increases from 0.95 to 0.96, and for thyroid eye disease from 0.79 to 0.89. The EMR signatures recapitulate known comorbidities with diabetes, such as abnormal glucose, but do not significantly modulate image-derived features.

The research was divided into two periods: 2003\u20132012 and 2013\u20132023.\n\nThe subject of this study is the keywords extracted from a total of 117 studies related to behavioral activation (including 8 literatures from Korea). To minimize bias in the process of keyword collection, a wide range of studies were searched using 2 Korean and 3 international databases. For the collection of keywords, searches for foreign literature utilized PubMed, PsycINFO, and MEDLINE, which are most used in behavioral activation-related review literature. For Korean literature, Research Information Sharing Service (RISS) and Korea Citation Index (KCI) were employed. The search keywords were set as \u201cBA\u201d or \u201cBehavioral activation,\u201d and after reviewing the titles and abstracts of relevant literature, the final literature was selected, and keywords contained in the literature were extracted.\n\nThe criteria for selecting literature for this study are as follows: 1) Literature that includes the search terms \u201cBA\u201d or \u201cBehavioral activation\u201d in the title and keywords, and 2) Experimental research literature targeting humans. Exclusion criteria include: 1) Review literature, 2) Literature where BA therapeutic approach is included as a subcategory in treatment approaches such as CBT, ACT, 3) Grey literature not published in academic journals, 4) Theses, reports, books, and conference presentations, 5) Literature not in English or Korean, and 6) Literature outside the analysis period of this study. The search period was divided into two periods based on the reporting of BA therapeutic approach-related clinical studies starting from 2003, with each period spanning 10 years: Period 1 (2003\u20132012) and Period 2 (2013\u20132023) and analyzed accordingly.\n\nThe results of literature collection for this study are presented in (Fig 1). During Period 1, a total of 140 studies were retrieved, of which 80 were excluded due to mismatched research topics and designs after the first screening, along with 37 duplicate studies, resulting in the exclusion of 117 studies. Consequently, 23 studies were collected. Upon secondary review, 7 studies that were not experimental studies involving participants were excluded, leaving a total of 16 studies collected for Period 1 of this study. In Period 2, a total of 1,940 domestic and international studies were identified. Following the first screening, 1,791 items were excluded due to mismatched research topics and designs, along with 42 duplicate items, resulting in the exclusion of 1,833 studies. Subsequently, 107 studies were collected. Upon secondary review, 5 studies that were not experimental studies involving participants, 1 duplicate item, and 2 items not in English were excluded. Additionally, 2 studies were added through hand search, resulting in a final collection of 101 studies for Period 2\n\n---\n\n[Tae Hyun Hwang 2023, PMID:37190310]\nTitle: Immunotherapy for Peritoneal Carcinomatosis: Challenges and Prospective Outcomes.\nAbstract: Peritoneal metastasis, also known as peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC), is a refractory cancer that is typically resistant to conventional therapies. The typical treatment for PC is a combination of cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC). Recently, research in this area has seen significant advances, particularly in immunotherapy as an alternative therapy for PC, which is very encouraging. Catumaxomab is a trifunctional antibody intraperitoneal (IP) immunotherapy authorized in Europe that can be used to diminish malignant ascites by targeting EpCAM. Intraperitoneal (IP) immunotherapy breaks immunological tolerance to treat peritoneal illness. Increasing T-cell responses and vaccination against tumor-associated antigens are two methods of treatment. CAR-T cells, vaccine-based therapeutics, dendritic cells (DCs) in combination with pro-inflammatory cytokines and NKs, adoptive cell transfer, and immune checkpoint inhibitors are promising treatments for PC. Carcinoembryonic antigen-expressing tumors are suppressed by IP administration of CAR-T cells. This reaction was strengthened by anti-PD-L1 or anti-Gr1. When paired with CD137 co-stimulatory signaling, CAR-T cells for folate receptor cancers made it easier for T-cell tumors to find their way to and stay alive in the body.\n\n---\n\n[Tae Hyun Hwang 2025, PMID:40628457]\nTitle: Cancer outcomes in women without upfront surgery for ductal carcinoma in situ: observational cohort study.\nFull Text (excerpt): ## METHODS\n\n\n\nThe data for this study were collected through the 2018 Commission on Cancer Special Study on DCIS, in collaboration with the American College of Surgeons. Through the Commission on Cancer Special Study mechanism, detailed longitudinal patient data were collected from original source documentation at each site in a stratified random sample of patients with a diagnosis of primary DCIS.\n\nThe sampling frame for the special study was based on the 2015 NCDB Participant User File.11 The main eligibility criteria were female sex, age 18 years or older, and a pathology confirmed diagnosis of DCIS without invasive cancer between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2015 (supplementary table A). Eligible patients were divided into two groups: those who had received upfront surgery, either with or without radiation, within six months of diagnosis, and those who did not (supplementary table B). A treatment stratified random sample of up to 20 eligible patients from each of the 1330 participating Commission on Cancer facilities was identified; women without upfront surgery were oversampled, accounting for up to 10 selected patients per facility.\n\nBetween 16 July 2018 and 26 October 2018, cancer registrars at each participating site abstracted in-depth data about diagnosis, treatment, subsequent breast cancer events (DCIS, invasive breast cancer, lymph node cancer, distant breast cancer metastasis), and survival (including cause of death) for up to 10 years after diagnosis or date of abstraction, whichever came first. Data abstraction was based on primary chart review at treating facilities; when necessary, registrars requested the relevant information from outside facilities.\n\nOn the basis of the records abstracted through the Commission on Cancer Special Study on DCIS, we made the following exclusions for our study: women who received any surgery or radiation treatment within six months of diagnosis; women who died or experienced a breast cancer event within six months of diagnosis; women with multiple primaries; and women for whom registrars were not able to assess whether a subsequent breast event took place during follow-up (fig 1).\n\nStudy cohort. NCDB=National Cancer Database\n\nTo assess the quality of data abstraction, we considered women in the Commission on Cancer Special Study who had received breast conserving surgery, with or without radiation treatment, within six months of diagnosis (fig 1). For this cohort, we included only women who had pure DCIS on surgical pathology.\n\nOur choice of using the six month mark to define the study cohort was motivated by the distribution of the time to first surgery among all women in the special study who received breast conserving surgery within one year of diagnosis. In this cohort, 95% of women had surgery in the first four months, identifying six months as a conservative cut-off point. We did sensitivity analyses around this choice (see Statistical analysis).\n\nThe primary outcome was subsequent diagnos\n\nPropose a novel method combining techniques from at least 2 papers.\n\nFormat your response as:\n<think>\n[Step-by-step reasoning about how methods complement each other]\n</think>\n\nHYPOTHESIS: [Novel combined approach]\nRATIONALE: [Why combining is beneficial]\nMETHODS: [Technical details of integration]\nEXPECTED OUTCOME: [Performance improvements expected]\n\nIMPORTANT: Cite papers as [Author Year, PMID:XXXXX].

Written informed consent was obtained from non-IBD control and CD subjects to obtain serum samples, as well as, terminal ileum (TI) and ascending colon (AC) tissues at the time of scheduled endoscopic procedures. TI and AC tissues from non-IBD control and CD subjects undergoing surgical resection were also obtained from under a separate IRB protocol in coordination with the Comparative Human Tissue Network (CHTN). All samples were obtained as a part of the clinical trial \u201cCombinatorial Single Cell Strategies for a Crohn\u2019s Disease Gut Cell Atlas\u201d, identifier NCT04113733 (clinicaltrials.gov).\n\nBetween December 2019 and January 2022, endoscopy subjects were prospectively recruited in the IBD clinic or GI endoscopy unit at Vanderbilt University Medical Center prior to colonoscopy for CD disease activity assessment or non-IBD indications including colorectal cancer screening or polyp surveillance. Surgical resection subjects were those undergoing resection for CD-related complications or other non-inflammatory indications, including endoscopically unresectable polyps. Patient participation in the current study ended after serum and/or tissue samples were obtained. Exclusion criteria for the study were: pregnancy, known coagulopathy or bleeding disorders, known renal or hepatic impairment, history of organ transplantation, or inability to give informed consent. After appropriate exclusions, there were 65 CD subjects with varying disease activity and 18 non-IBD controls.\n\nFor all participants, demographics including age, gender, medical history, and medication use were determined from participant reporting and review of the electronic medical record. Serum samples were obtained at the time of colonoscopy and were snap frozen with dry ice and then stored at \u221280\u2009\u00b0C39,67. Tissue biopsies for research purposes in the TI and AC were obtained as follows: fresh tissue biopsies were placed in chelation buffer (4\u2009mM EDTA, 0.5\u2009mM DTT in DPBS) for further processing and scRNAseq analysis, and an adjacent set of tissue biopsies were formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) for research blocks. 5\u2009\u00b5m sections were used from each FFPE block and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and examined in a blinded manner by a gastrointestinal pathologist (MKW) and graded accordingly as: inactive (normal_CD, quiescent) or active (mild, moderate, or severe activity). All associated study data were collected and managed using Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) electronic data capture tools hosted at Vanderbilt68,69, including Clinical Data Interoperability Services, such as Clinical Data Pull70 and e-consent71.\n\nSingle-cell RNA-sequencing was performed on human biopsies and surgical specimens72,73.

Our proposed framework can be divided into three sections: (1)\u00a0super-resolution preprocessing, (2)\u00a0coarse unbiased template generation, and (3)\u00a0hierarchical deep probabilistic registration refinement.\n\nComplete pipeline for unbiased eye atlas generation consists of two stages: (1)\u00a0performing a deep learning super-resolution algorithm to enhance image quality and distinguish organ appearances and (2)\u00a0combining metric-based and deep learning-based registration through a hierarchical registration framework for refined anatomical transfer.\n\nWe applied the synthetic multi-orientation resolution enhancement (SMORE) algorithm to generate super-resolution images.9,35 We select SMORE as the super-resolution algorithm because it is self-supervised and does not require external training data. Other self-supervised super-resolution algorithms require orthogonal views of the same image across multiple contrasts36 or train on a batch of images instead of each image independently.37\n\nThe input image for SMORE is an anisotropic volume, modeled with a spatial resolution of l\u00d7l\u00d7h, where l and h have units of mm and h>l. Here, the images have a high ratio between the in-plane resolution and through-plane resolution (h/l>6). SMORE learns a correspondence between low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR) image patches using only the in-plane slices as training data. The output of SMORE is an isotropic HR image with resolution l\u00d7l\u00d7l.\n\nGiven the enriched context from the super-resolution algorithm in the prior step, we can now use the super-resolution images to create a generalized eye organ representation as a population-wise atlas template. Typically, we perform image registration to align and match the eye anatomy with imaging tools, e.g., ANTs and NiftyReg.38,39 However, registration to a single target image with these tools is biased to a single-fixed reference template.\n\nTo tackle this bias, we apply an unbiased template generation method that results in a coarse, generalized template despite the significant variance in eye morphology. Specifically, for each tissue contrast, we randomly sampled a small set of 25 subjects and generated an average mapping to coarsely align the skull region. The initial template is an average mapping of the 25 subjects, meaning it is unbiased to any of the subjects.13,40 We performed hierarchical metric-based registration (consisting of rigid, affine, and then deformable registration) with ANTs to iteratively compute an average mapping in a separate spatial alignment for each tissue contrast. The computed average template in each epoch was the fixed template for the next epoch. We performed the same hierarchical procedure iteratively until the registration loss converged. We leveraged a small popul\n\n---\n\n[Yuankai Huo 2023, PMID:36691973]\nTitle: Prenatal depressive symptoms and childhood development of brain limbic and default mode network structure.\nFull Text (excerpt): # Paper 36691973\n\n**Professor:** Huo\n**PMID:** 36691973\n\n## Full Text\n\nReceived: 18 July 2022       Revised: 20 December 2022       Accepted: 4 January 2023\nDOI: 10.1002/hbm.26216\nRESEARCH ARTICLE\nPrenatal depressive symptoms and childhood development of\nbrain limbic and default mode network structure\nClaire Donnici 1                   | Xiangyu Long 2,3                    | Jess Reynolds 4                     |\n1,2,5,6                                       1,2,5,6,7\nGerald F.

The resulting performance from these approaches is, however, impeded by standard network switches since they can saturate network bandwidth during transfer from storage to processing nodes for even moderate-sized studies. To that end, a cloud-based \"medical image processing-as-a-service\" offers promise in utilizing the ecosystem of Apache Hadoop, which is a flexible framework providing distributed, scalable, fault tolerant storage and parallel computational modules, and HBase, which is a NoSQL database built atop Hadoop's distributed file system. Despite this promise, HBase's load distribution strategy of region split and merge is detrimental to the hierarchical organization of imaging data (e.g., project, subject, session, scan, slice). This paper makes two contributions to address these concerns by describing key cloud engineering principles and technology enhancements we made to the Apache Hadoop ecosystem for medical imaging applications. First, we propose a row-key design for HBase, which is a necessary step that is driven by the hierarchical organization of imaging data. Second, we propose a novel data allocation policy within HBase to strongly enforce collocation of hierarchically related imaging data. The proposed enhancements accelerate data processing by minimizing network usage and localizing processing to machines where the data already exist. Moreover, our approach is amenable to the traditional scan, subject, and project-level analysis procedures, and is compatible with standard command line/scriptable image processing software. Experimental results for an illustrative sample of imaging data reveals that our new HBase policy results in a three-fold time improvement in conversion of classic DICOM to NiFTI file formats when compared with the default HBase region split policy, and nearly a six-fold improvement over a commonly available network file system (NFS) approach even for relatively small file sets. Moreover, file access latency is lower than network attached storage.\n\n---\n\n[Bennett Landman 2024, PMID:38280312]\nTitle: Perivascular space burden interacts with APOE-\u03b54 status on cognition in older adults.\nAbstract: Enlarged perivascular spaces (ePVS) may adversely affect cognition. Little is known about how basal ganglia ePVS interact with apolipoprotein (APOE)-\u03b54 status. Vanderbilt Memory and Aging Project participants (n\u00a0=\u00a0326, 73\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07, 59% male) underwent 3\u00a0T brain MRI at baseline to assess ePVS and longitudinal neuropsychological assessments. The interaction between ePVS volume and APOE-\u03b54 carrier status was related to baseline outcomes using ordinary least squares regressions and longitudinal cognition using linear mixed-effects regressions. ePVS volume interacted with APOE-\u03b54 status on cross-sectional naming performance (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.002, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002), and executive function excluding outliers (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.001, p\u00a0=\u00a00.009). There were no significant longitudinal interactions (p-values>0.10) except for Coding excluding outliers (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.002, p\u00a0=\u00a00.05). While cross-sectional models stratified by APOE-\u03b54 status indicated greater ePVS related to worse cognition mostly in APOE-\u03b54 carriers, longitudinal models stratified by APOE-\u03b54 status showed greater ePVS volume related to worse cognition among APOE-\u03b54 non-carriers only. Results indicated that greater ePVS volume interacts with APOE-\u03b54 status on cognition cross-sectionally. Longitudinally, the association of greater ePVS volume and worse cognition appears stronger in APOE-\u03b54 non-carriers, possibly due to the deleterious effects of APOE-\u03b54 on cognition across the lifespan.\n\nGenerate a hypothesis that addresses what is NOT covered by any paper but could be addressed by combining their approaches.\n\nFormat your response as:\n<think>\n[Step-by-step reasoning about the gap]\n</think>\n\nHYPOTHESIS: [One sentence]\nRATIONALE: [Why novel and feasible]\nMETHODS: [Specific approach with datasets]\nEXPECTED OUTCOME: [Testable prediction with metrics]\n\nIMPORTANT: Cite papers as [Author Year, PMID:XXXXX].

With the advent of advanced diffusion MRI\nmodels \u2013 e.g., the neurite orientation dispersion density imaging (NODDI), it is of interest to\nanalyze microstructural changes within gray matter (GM). A recent study has proposed using\nNODDI in gray matter based spatial statistics (N-GBSS) to perform voxel-wise statistical analysis\non GM microstructure. N-GBSS adapts TBSS by skeletonizing the GM and projecting diffusion\nAuthor Manuscript\nmetrics to a cortical ribbon. In this study, we propose an alternate approach, known as gray matter\nsurface based spatial statistics (GS-BSS), to perform statistical analysis using gray matter surfaces\nby incorporating established methods of registration techniques of GM surface segmentation on\nstructural images. Diffusion microstructure features from NODDI and GM surfaces are transferred\nto standard space. All the surfaces are then projected onto a common GM surface non-linearly\nusing diffeomorphic spectral matching on cortical surfaces. Prior post-mortem studies have shown\nreduced dendritic length in prefrontal cortex region in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder\npopulation. To validate the results, statistical tests are compared between GS-BSS and N-GBSS to\nstudy the differences between healthy and psychosis population. Significant results confirming the\nmicrostructural changes are presented.

As an example, DAPI staining\nidentifies cell nuclei, while CD20 staining helps segment cell membranes in MxIF. However,\na persistent challenge in MxIF is saturation artifacts, which hinder single-cell level analysis\nin areas with over-saturated pixels. Traditional gamma correction methods for fixing saturation\nare limited, often incorrectly assuming uniform distribution of saturation, which is rarely the\ncase in practice. This paper introduces a novel approach to correct saturation artifacts from a\ndata-driven perspective. We introduce a two-stage, high-resolution hybrid generative adversarial\nAuthor Manuscript\nnetwork (HDmixGAN), which merges unpaired (CycleGAN) and paired (pix2pixHD) network\narchitectures. This approach is designed to capitalize on the available small-scale paired data and\nthe more extensive unpaired data from costly MxIF data. Specifically, we generate pseudo-paired\ndata from large-scale unpaired over-saturated datasets with a CycleGAN, and train a Pix2pixGAN\nusing both small-scale real and large-scale synthetic data derived from multiple DAPI staining\nrounds in MxIF.

Typically, one\nmanually labels new training images when segmenting organs in different imaging modalities or\nsegmenting abnormal organs from distinct disease cohorts. The manual efforts can be alleviated\nif one is able to reuse manual labels from one modality (e.g., MRI) to train a segmentation\nnetwork for a new modality (e.g., CT). Previously, two stage methods have been proposed\nto use cycle generative adversarial networks (CycleGAN) to synthesize training images for a\nAuthor Manuscript\ntarget modality. Then, these efforts trained a segmentation network independently using synthetic\nimages. However, these two independent stages did not use the complementary information\nbetween synthesis and segmentation. Herein, we proposed a novel end-to-end synthesis and\nsegmentation network (EssNet) to achieve the unpaired MRI to CT image synthesis and CT\nsplenomegaly segmentation simultaneously without using manual labels on CT. The end-to-end\nEssNet achieved significantly higher median Dice similarity coefficient (0.9188) than the two\nstages strategy (0.8801), and even higher than canonical multi-atlas segmentation (0.9125) and\nResNet method (0.9107), which used the CT manual labels.\n1.    INTRODUCTION\nSplenomegaly, the condition of having an abnormally large spleen (e.g., >500 cubic\nAuthor Manuscript\ncentimeter), is a biomarker for liver disease, infection and cancer. Previous automated\nmethods have been proposed to perform segmentation on normal spleens [1, 2] and with\nsplenomegaly [3\u20135]. Recently, deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) based methods\nhave been used in splenomegaly and shown superior performance [6, 7]. However, one\nmajor limitation of deploying DCNN methods is that one typically has to manually trace a\nnew set of training data when segmenting organs in a new imaging modality or segmenting\nabnormal organs from a new disease cohort. For instance, a DCNN trained with normal\nspleens was not able to capture the spatial variations of splenomegaly (Fig. 1). Therefore, a\nstraightforward solution is to manually annotate a set of splenomeg\n\n---\n\n[Yuankai Huo 2022, PMID:35864991]\nTitle: Editorial: Intelligent Recognition and Detection in Neuroimaging.\nFull Text (excerpt): # Paper 35864991\n\n**Professor:** Huo\n**PMID:** 35864991\n\n## Full Text\n\nEDITORIAL\npublished: 05 July 2022\ndoi: 10.3389/fnins.2022.943180\nEditorial: Intelligent Recognition and\nDetection in Neuroimaging\nYu-Dong Zhang 1*, German Castellanos-Dominguez 2 , Yuankai Huo 3 , Juan Manuel Gorriz 4\nand Roohallah Alizadehsani 5\n1\nSchool of Computing and Mathematical Sciences, University of Leicester, Leicester, United Kingdom, 2 Department of\nElectrical Engineering, National University of Colombia, Manizales, Colombia, 3 Department of Electrical Engineering and\nComputer Science, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, United States, 4 Department of Signal Theory, Networking and\nCommunications, University of Granada, Granada, Spain, 5 Institute for Intelligent Systems Research and Innovation, Deakin\nUniversity, Geelong, VIC, Australia\nKeywords: intelligent recognition, neuroimaging, EEG, MRI, PET\nEditorial on the Research Topic\nIntelligent Recognition and Detection in Neuroimaging\nNeuroimaging scan uses various techniques to either directly or indirectly image the nervous\nsystem\u2019s structure, function, or pharmacology.

The digitization of EMR provides potential access to a wealth of medical information, but presents new challenges in algorithm design and inference. Previous studies, such as Phenome Wide Association Study (PheWAS), have shown that EMR data can be used to investigate the relationship between genotypes and clinical conditions. Here, we introduce Phenome-Disease Association Study to extend the statistical capabilities of the PheWAS software through a custom Python package, which creates diagnostic EMR signatures to capture system-wide co-morbidities for a disease population within a given time interval. We investigate the effect of integrating these EMR signatures with radiological data to improve diagnostic classification in disease domains known to have confounding factors because of variable and complex clinical presentation. Specifically, we focus on two studies: First, a study of four major optic nerve related conditions; and second, a study of diabetes. Addition of EMR signature vectors to radiologically derived structural metrics improves the area under the curve (AUC) for diagnostic classification using elastic net regression, for diseases of the optic nerve. For glaucoma, the AUC improves from 0.71 to 0.83, for intrinsic optic nerve disease it increases from 0.72 to 0.91, for optic nerve edema it increases from 0.95 to 0.96, and for thyroid eye disease from 0.79 to 0.89. The EMR signatures recapitulate known comorbidities with diabetes, such as abnormal glucose, but do not significantly modulate image-derived features. In summary, EMR signatures present a scalable and readily applicable.\n\n---\n\n[Bennett Landman 2019, PMID:34456460]\nTitle: Inter-Scanner Harmonization of High Angular Resolution DW-MRI using Null Space Deep Learning.\nAbstract: Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) allows for non-invasive imaging of the local fiber architecture of the human brain at a millimetric scale. Multiple classical approaches have been proposed to detect both single (e.g., tensors) and multiple (e.g., constrained spherical deconvolution, CSD) fiber population orientations per voxel. However, existing techniques generally exhibit low reproducibility across MRI scanners. Herein, we propose a data-driven technique using a neural network design which exploits two categories of data. First, training data were acquired on three squirrel monkey brains using ex-vivo DW-MRI and histology of the brain. Second, repeated scans of human subjects were acquired on two different scanners to augment the learning of the network proposed. To use these data, we propose a new network architecture, the null space deep network (NSDN), to simultaneously learn on traditional observed/truth pairs (e.g., MRI-histology voxels) along with repeated observations without a known truth (e.g., scan-rescan MRI). The NSDN was tested on twenty percent of the histology voxels that were kept completely blind to the network. NSDN significantly improved absolute performance relative to histology by 3.87% over CSD and 1.42% over a recently proposed deep neural network approach. Moreover, it improved reproducibility on the paired data by 21.19% over CSD and 10.09% over a recently proposed deep approach. Finally, NSDN improved generalizability of the model to a third \n\n---\n\n[Bennett Landman 2025, PMID:40545560]\nTitle: The association between poor sleep health and Alzheimer's disease structural neuroimaging biomarkers\nFull Text (excerpt): ## METHODS\n\n\n\nVanderbilt Memory and Aging Project participants (N\u00a0=\u00a0407; median age: 70 years) wore ActiGraph accelerometers for 10 days to estimate sleep regularity, timing, efficiency, duration, wake\u2010after\u2010sleep onset, and awakening length. Volume in brain regions of interest (ROIs) and AD signatures were quantified using 3T brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Cross\u2010sectional linear regression models were adjusted for sociodemographic and lifestyle factors, depression, cognitive status, and cardiovascular risk. ROI and McEvoy models were adjusted for total intracranial volume.\n\nThis cross\u2010sectional study included community\u2010sampled participants from the Vanderbilt Memory and Aging Project (VMAP). Briefly, VMAP is a longitudinal observational cohort study launched in September 2012 at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, TN, USA. From 2012 to 2014, 336 participants were enrolled in the VMAP Legacy Cohort. In 2021, an Expansion Cohort was launched with 615 adults enrolled to date. Inclusion in the VMAP Legacy Cohort required participants to be at least 60 years old with adequate auditory and visual acuity, able to speak English, have a reliable study partner, and either be CU or meet the diagnostic criteria for early cognitive impairment or mild cognitive impairment (MCI).\n21\n Participants were excluded from VMAP if they had 3T MRI contraindication, a history of neurological disorders (e.g., dementia, stroke, or head injury with the loss of consciousness greater than 5 minutes), major psychiatric illness, heart failure, or terminal illness affecting longitudinal participation. The same inclusion and exclusion criteria applied to the VMAP Expansion Cohort, except for age, which was lowered to a minimum of 50 years old, and all Expansion Cohort participants were CU. Data collection methods for these two cohorts are identical, except for minor differences in MRI acquisition parameters. For this analysis, the measures were consolidated. The present study used actigraphy, neuroimaging, and neuropsychological data collected from discrete participants when actigraphy monitors were introduced in the Legacy Cohort at 18 months (2014\u20132016) and at 3 years (2015\u20132018). Expansion Cohort participants were asked to wear actigraphy monitors at study entry (2021\u2013ongoing). A participant's first actigraphy assessment was considered baseline. The Vanderbilt University Medical Center Institutional Review Board approved the VMAP protocol, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to data collection. Data from the VMAP cohort can be accessed freely after data use approval (www.vmacdata.org).\n\nOur analytic sample included VMAP Legacy Cohort and VMAP Expansion Cohort participants (N\u00a0=\u00a0464) with valid actigraphy data (Figure\u00a0S1 in supporting information).

Cancer vaccines are an attractive strategy to boost patient immune responses, but less is known about whether and how immunization can induce long-term tumor immune reprogramming and arrest cancer progression. We developed a clinically-relevant genetic cancer mouse model in which hepatocytes sporadically undergo oncogenic transformation. We compared how tumor-specific CD8 T cells (TST) differentiate in mice with early sporadic lesions as compared to late lesions and tested how immunotherapeutic strategies, including vaccination and ICB, reprogram TST and impact liver cancer progression. METHODS: Mice with a germline floxed allele of the SV40 large T antigen (TAG) undergo spontaneous recombination and activation of the TAG oncogene, leading to rare early pre-cancerous lesions that inevitably progress to established liver cancer. We assessed the immunophenotype and function of TAG-specific CD8 T cells in mice with early and late liver lesions. We vaccinated mice, either alone or in combination with ICB, to test whether these immunotherapeutic interventions could stop liver cancer progression. RESULTS: In mice with early lesions, a subset of TST were PD1  CONCLUSION: Vaccination, but not ICB, generated a population of progenitor TST and halted cancer progression in a clinically relevant model of sporadic liver cancer. In patients with early cancers or at high-risk of cancer recurrence, immunization may be the most effective strategy. WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC: Immunotherapy, including immune checkpoint blockade and cancer vaccines, fails to induce long-term remissions in most patients with cancer. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Hosts with early lesions but not hosts with advanced cancer retain a progenitor TCF1+ TST population. This population can be reprogrammed and therapeutically exploited by vaccination, but not ICB, to block tumor progression. HOW THIS STUDY MIGHT AFFECT RESEARCH PRACTICE OR POLICY: For people at high-risk of cancer progression, vaccination administered when a responsive progenitor TST population is present may be the optimal immunotherapy to induce long-lasting progression-free survival.\n\n---\n\n[Tae Hyun Hwang 2024, PMID:38571426]\nTitle: The 3D Revolution in Cancer Discovery.\nAbstract: The transition from 2D to 3D spatial profiling marks a revolutionary era in cancer research, offering unprecedented potential to enhance cancer diagnosis and treatment.

Resnick2, and Bennett A. Landman1\n1Electrical Engineering, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN\n2Laboratory of Behavioral Neuroscience, National Institute on Aging, Baltimore, MD\nAbstract\nLongitudinal reproducibility is an essential concern in automated medical image segmentation, yet\nAuthor Manuscript\nhas proven to be an elusive objective as manual brain structure tracings have shown more than\n10% variability. To improve reproducibility, longitudinal segmentation (4D) approaches have been\ninvestigated to reconcile temporal variations with traditional 3D approaches. In the past decade,\nmulti-atlas label fusion has become a state-of-the-art segmentation technique for 3D image and\nmany efforts have been made to adapt it to a 4D longitudinal fashion. However, the previous\nmethods were either limited by using application specified energy function (e.g., surface fusion\nand multi model fusion) or only considered temporal smoothness on two consecutive time points (t\nand t+1) under sparsity assumption. Therefore, a 4D multi-atlas label fusion theory for general\nlabel fusion purpose and simultaneously considering temporal consistency on all time points is\nappealing. Herein, we propose a novel longitudinal label fusion algorithm, called 4D joint label\nfusion (4DJLF), to incorporate the temporal consistency modeling via non-local patch-intensity\ncovariance models. The advantages of 4DJLF include: (1) 4DJLF is under the general label fusion\nAuthor Manuscript\nframework by simultaneously incorporating the spatial and temporal covariance on all longitudinal\ntime points. (2) The proposed algorithm is a longitudinal generalization of a leading joint label\nfusion method (JLF) that has proven adaptable to a wide variety of applications. (3) The spatial\ntemporal consistency of atlases is modeled in a probabilistic model inspired from both voting\nbased and statistical fusion. The proposed approach improves the consistency of the longitudinal\nsegmentation while retaining sensitivity compared with original JLF approach using the same set\nof atlases. The method is available online in open-source.\n1 Introduction\nAn essential challenge in volumetric (3D) image segmentation on longitudinal medical\nimages is to ensure the temporal consistency while retaining sensitivity. Many efforts have\nAuthor Manuscript\nbeen made to incorporate the temporal dimension into volumetric segmentation (4D).
